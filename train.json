{"prompt": "Is This Old Study Book A Fine Resource? P.S. what is this sticker?", "completion": "Regarding the sticker, Cefyl is a military abbreviation for *centrala flygs√§kerhetsledningen*, the central flight safety command of the Swedish air force. By the 1970's, its main function was to coordinate the air force's search and rescue operations. In 1978 it merged with its civilian counterpart, the Air Rescue Coordination Center, and the organization was then known as Flygr√§ddningscentralen/Cefyl, and later ARCC/Cefyl (especially in international contexts). In 2010 it was merged again, this time with its maritime counterpart, and became the Joint Rescue Coordination Center, JRCC, which coordinates all search and rescue operations in the country.\n\nI'd guess the sticker is from the 80's; certainly after the ARCC/Cefyl merger but before the JAS 39 Gripen entered service in the mid 1990's (the fighter silhouette in the top left is the predecessor, a Saab 37 Viggen).

Sometimes it is tricky because a similar sentence could easily be something like: *ibland √§r de****t*** *inte tr√•ng****t*** *p√• restaurangen.*\n\nWhen speaking about something in the hypothetical or when using something for an example, it is rare to use \"en/ett\". Using the definitive article is much more common. Swedish in general uses its definitive articles more often than English. That's why in my sentence above, I used *restaurangEN* instead of *en restaurang.*\n\n*Alls* could be translated as \"at all\" but in English this is an adverbial phrase and can thus be put in several places in a sentence. In Swedish its just an adverb and needs to be in the regular adverb position when modifying an adjective.\n\nHere is another example: [https://sv.wiktionary.org/wiki/alls](https://sv.wiktionary.org/wiki/alls)\n\nWhen discussing political entities, we always use \"i\", not \"p√•\". So it's \"i USA\". Sometimes Swedes get confused when islands are also nations, but never when discussing nations who are not islands.\n\n.\n\nPS. Small, easy bonus here. \"J√§tte\" is a very useful word, but it will **always** be part of the word it is modifying (\"J√§ttebra\"). **Never** \"j√§tte bra\" or \"J√§tte snygg\" or \"j√§tte trevligt\", and so on."}

{"prompt": "Does anyone else speak Greek?", "completion": "Typically, people apply a phonological transfer of sounds from their native language when they encounter new sounds.\n\nIn Greek, front rounded vowels doesn't exist. E.g. you might pronounce the Swedish <y> as upsilon, but it's more like the English \"ee\" in \"see\" (/i:/) but rounded, i.e. with pouted lips like you're making an <oo> sound.\n\nYou might pronounce the Swedish <u> sound like the <ou> in in souvlaki, but it's a central vowel / â:/ that should be pronounced with your tongue further forward in your mouth.\n\nYou might pronounce the Swedish sj-sound as in œáœéŒºŒ±, but it's softer, pronounced further forward and with slightly pursed lips. There's also the front-sj sound, and most Swedes use both variants of the sj-sounds.\n\nSwedish voiceless stops (p, t, k) are aspirated in stressed syllable onsets, giving them a softer sound than in Greek. It's more like breathing out a puff of air than releasing pressure.\n\nSwedish has pitch accent, which is hard to get right for foreigners. The pitch contour is rise-fall-rise for acute accent and rise-fall for grave accent.\n\nGreek is a syllable-timed language while Swedish is stress-timed (like English). I.e., in Greek, each syllable takes roughly the same time to pronounce, but in Swedish the time between stressed syllables is kept roughly equal, and unstressed syllables gets de-emphasized and stretched to fit.\n\nGreek only has 5 vowels sounds, but Swedish has 16-20 vowels sounds, depending on how you count. In particular, most vowels have different prononciations whether they're long or short.\n\nHere are some minimal word pairs, you can look up the prononciation of each word in Svensk Ordbok and click on the audio icon.\n\n* a - hat/hatt\n* e-√§ - het/hett (short e and √§ sounds are generally pronounced the same)\n* √§-√§ - h√§l/h√§ll (short e and √§ sounds are generally pronounced the same)\n* i - sil/sill\n* o-√• - mor/morr (short o and √• sounds are generally pronounced the same)\n* √•-√• - m√•l/m√•ll (short o and √• sounds are generally pronounced the same)\n* u - ful/full\n* y - syl/syll\n* √∂ - n√∂t/n√∂tt\n\nWhen followed by -r, the √§ and √∂ sounds get a different quality. (/…õ/ -> /√¶/, /≈ì/ -> /√∏/).\n\n* √§r - k√§r/k√§rr\n* √∂r - f√∂r/f√∂rr\n\nMinimal pairs between typical and and r-versions of √§ and √∂:\n\n* √∂ - √§ga/√§ra (/…õÀêga/ - /√¶Àêra/)\n* √∂ - √∂ga/√∂ra (/≈ìÀêga/ - /√∏Àêra/)\n\nWhen preceded by r-, some consonants merge with r into a retroflex consonant, i.e. pronounced with a thicker sound with your tongue curled backwards.\n\n* d - or/ord\n* l - kal/karl\n* n - kon/korn\n* s - hiss/hirs (rs is the same as the front-sj sound)\n* t - spott/sport\n\nNote, this is for Standard Swedish based on east-central dialects.

There's some sounds that might give you away, all of which have been covered by /u/Ampersand55's excellent answer. I really just want to add a tiny tip for approximating the sj sound.\n\n\nTo _possibly_ make a better sj sound, you can try to start with a œÜ and stop touching your upper lip to your bottom teeth. Then, practice skipping the œÜ and just go for the sound with the lip and teeth not touching directly.\n\n\nGood luck!¬†"}

If you get them at least roughly right you'll be fine.\n\nGenerally speaking I wouldn't worry about \"sounding Greek\". I don't mean ignore pronunciation, but everyone has an accent and it's fine. The worst that might happen is you'll say something funny now and then. Your first priority should be communicating and expressing yourself well."}
{"prompt": "Does anyone else speak Greek?", "completion": "I also struggle with particular consonants and vowels. Even the simple looking 'i' is not as easy as I thought or √∂ which I thought that I already knew it. I discovered that long 'i' is different from the sound in 'see'. And since the y comes from i it's also even more difficult to get it right. The sj with some vowels are more difficult. The 'rt' is not that bad but also different from 'rt' in english as far as I notice both american and british. In fact, when I listen carefully I find that even the easier sounds I thought I got right were actually off. Also knowing what consonants to skip is also hard. Overall, in my opinion, it boils down to not knowing what's right or wrong when you say it. So even you say something in a wrong way and no one is correcting you then you will never know what's right and might just keep repeating the same mistakes."}

{"prompt": "Why is ‚Äúf√∂rl√•t‚Äù pronounced like ‚Äúfy-loht‚Äù instead of ‚Äúfor-loht‚Äù?", "completion": "‚ü®√∂‚ü© has a vastly different pronunciation from ‚ü®o‚ü©, being closer to the /e/ sound. Its relative vicinity to /y/ might be what's fooling you here.\n\n(That said, in some Swedish dialects, the pronunciation of ‚ü®√∂‚ü© is approaching the /…µ/ sound; maybe that's what you're hearing. )"}
{"prompt": "Why is ‚Äúf√∂rl√•t‚Äù pronounced like ‚Äúfy-loht‚Äù instead of ‚Äúfor-loht‚Äù?", "completion": "I would guess that it is one of those words that get contracted because it is used relatively frequently and basically by itself in short interactions. It‚Äôs not uncommon to say ‚Äôscuse me in English when meeting someone in a narrow doorway for example. \n\n√ñ is a very open vowel that is sometimes pronounced in a less open way, closer to the English shwa-vowel, and r has a tendency to be dropped (or actually merge with the vowel) in such cases. The expression ‚Äùf√∂r j√§vligt‚Äù is often pronounced ‚Äùfej√§vlit‚Äù for example.\n\nBut, as in English, it is less likely to be contracted phonetically if used in a sentence where it actually carries meaning rather than as a one word utterance as you pass someone you don‚Äôt actually have a conversation with. So if you would say something like ‚ÄùPlease excuse us for the inconvenience‚Äù you would not say ‚Äùscuse‚Äù and in Swedish you would pronounce it closer to what the spelling approximates. \n\nIn Stockholm middle class accents /√∂/ before /r/ is actually pronounced more openly, as close to /a/, probably to distance the accent from working class accents where /√∂/ is more clearly /√∂/ and particularly √§ is pronounced /e/. \n\nV√§g /va:g/ vs /ve:g/, and f√∂l /fa:l/ vs /f√∂:l/"}
{"prompt": "Why is ‚Äúf√∂rl√•t‚Äù pronounced like ‚Äúfy-loht‚Äù instead of ‚Äúfor-loht‚Äù?", "completion": "In IPA, I think it would look something like \\[f≈ì'lo:t\\]. I believe the r sound is assimilated since the consonant combination \"rl\" is awkward for speakers of Swedish."}
{"prompt": "Why is ‚Äúf√∂rl√•t‚Äù pronounced like ‚Äúfy-loht‚Äù instead of ‚Äúfor-loht‚Äù?", "completion": "The pronunciation varies a lot depending on dialect, so it's absolutely fine to pronounce the R as well."}
{"prompt": "Why is ‚Äúf√∂rl√•t‚Äù pronounced like ‚Äúfy-loht‚Äù instead of ‚Äúfor-loht‚Äù?", "completion": "As some others have pointed out, what you may be hearing is that sometimes f√∂rl√•t is shortened to f-l√•t and the \"√∂r\" part is just skipped over."}
{"prompt": "Why is ‚Äúf√∂rl√•t‚Äù pronounced like ‚Äúfy-loht‚Äù instead of ‚Äúfor-loht‚Äù?", "completion": "The r isn't really pronounced unless you speak slowly or in a very formal setting. But that's the only difference to how it's spelled."}
{"prompt": "A Swedish mile equal 6 miles?", "completion": "Yes, \"mil\" in Swedish means '10 km', which is about 6.2 miles."}
{"prompt": "A Swedish mile equal 6 miles?", "completion": "A swedish mile (or \"mil\", as we call it) is exactly 10km. As 1km = 0,625 miles, 10km = 6,25 miles.\n\nSwedish road signs are always in km, but in everyday talk we mostly deal with driving distances in mil. I have 184km to Gothenburg from where I live, but I'd normally say that I've got 18,5 mil."}
{"prompt": "A Swedish mile equal 6 miles?", "completion": "The main reason the metric system exists in the first place is that back in the day, countries and often even smaller regions in Europe all had their own mile, foot, inch, pound, ounce etc. \n\nA Swedish mile was 10,689 meters so when we went metric, it became really easy to redefine it to 10,000 m sharp. The Norwegians did the same to their mile, which used to be 11,295 m, so using that word for 10 km colloquially works in both countries. Not in Denmark, Iceland or Finland though, not even among the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland. \n\nRoad signs and official paperwork in Sweden and Norway use kilometers, but everyone thinks in miles and will tell you distances in that unit unless it's really close, like 7 km or 300 m."}
{"prompt": "A Swedish mile equal 6 miles?", "completion": "Kuriosa\n\nMil ing√•r ej i SI-systemet.\n\nInnan 1649 fanns landsskapsmil vilket kunde variera beroende p√• var i landet den angavs.\n\nSm√•landsmil ca 7000m\n\n√Öngermanlandsmil ca 11875m\n\nV√§stg√∂tamil ca 13000m\n\nFj√§llmil en vandring utan rast\n\nMen detta √§ndrades 1649 med inf√∂randet av en riksgemensam mil, Sverigemil.\n\nEn sverigemil = 3600 st√§nger = 6000 famnar = 18000 alnar = 36000 fot = 10688,4m\n\n1889 inf√∂rdes sedan metersystemet och i samband med det definierades en svensk mil som 10km=10000m."}
{"prompt": "A Swedish mile equal 6 miles?", "completion": "You need to check translations carefully around this. I have seen an English translation describing H√§lsingeleden (a long-distance walking trail) as being 16 miles long. It's 16 mil, ie, 160 km."}
{"prompt": "A Swedish mile equal 6 miles?", "completion": "I was in Storuman once, and had to get back to √ñstersund in a bit of an emergency. It's OK, they said, it's only 30 miles. (And they said it in English because my Swedish wasn't that good). \n\nYep. 300km.\n\nSo if someone in Sweden quotes a distance in miles to you, if they're speaking Swedish you can assume they mean mil = 10 km. If they are speaking English it's best to clarify."}
{"prompt": "A Swedish mile equal 6 miles?", "completion": "We call it mil, but mil and mile are obviously the same word. And it means different distances over time and places. A scandinavian mil is 10 km in all the nordic countries."}
{"prompt": "A Swedish mile equal 6 miles?", "completion": "A thing that many comments here seem to be ignoring is that in Sweden, when speaking English it is very common for Swedes to say \"mile\" and be referring to this 10k \"mil\". If you're lucky they may clarify \"oh I mean Swedish mile\" but not always. It's always best to make sure, because very often they are just (understandably) directly translating mil to mile in their heads. I see this quite similar to how people will often say \"crowns\" instead of \"kronor\". \nIt's just another reason to try to switch to speaking swedish as quickly as possible, things are generally more clear!"}

{"prompt": "Swedish audio-only beginner lessons?", "completion": "I second these suggestions but they are a little bit different.\n\n**Coffee break Swedish:** Listened to the first 32 episodes of coffee break Swedish and it is definitely good. Hannah (the teacher) explains grammar concepts. It is nice that Mark asks questions and you can follow along.\n\nNote that the learning along is not realistic. Mark followed extra lessons (which are accessible when you pay) and Mark is a polyglot (that knows some German and Norwegian). This means that it is unlikely that you can learn as quickly as Mark with just the free lessons. However, that does not have to be a problem. You will still learn a lot.\n\n**Learn Swedish with Karen:** I have only listened to two episodes so I can't tell a lot about this one. I feel it focuses a bit more on vocabulary. It feels like she pushes a lot more in a single lesson, which is probably because there is no small-talk like in Coffee break Swedish.\n\nShe also gives out homework, which you will not be able to do, in a car. For example, in one episode, she asks people to write down your daily routine in Swedish. I am planning to listen to more episodes as it does sound helpful.\n\nI personally think that Coffee break Swedish would be easier to listen to in a car ride, but 20 lessons in a row will be tough. I hope you'll have enough mental energy to also watch the road."}

So the order may change the subjekt and predikat in order to form a question: fr√•geord - predikat- subjekt- objekt?\n\nSo far the order is: \"Vad\" \n\nWhat HAPPENS? (Predikat)There is no actual verb, but what swedish calls a \"predikatsfyllnad\" (vara, bliva, heta, kallas)(to be, to become, to be named, to be called). They are not verbs but act like verb in a sentens. In this case some HAS a sickness \"har\" = predikatsfyllnad and acts as a verb = predikat.\n\nNext: WHO or WHAT  is taking action in the sentens? (Subjekt) \"patienten\" .\n\nSo the order is so far: \"Vad har patienten\"\n\nWHAT do the patient have? (Objekt) a sickness -  sjukdom. The word sjukdom is is undetermed and remeber the question? Therefor the question is: what KIND OF sickness? \n\nSo rak ordf√∂ljd/ normal: Vad har patienten f√∂r sjukdom?\n\nYou could turn the order around as you did, but then you would put the empasis on the sickness (objektet),  patienten (subjektet) becomes secondary to the sickness.\n \nDuolingo is good but lacks the grammer!

{"prompt": "Unknown grandparent", "completion": "They wouldn't be unknown in Swedish. Such scenario does not naturally arise in a Swedish context; it can't be clear someone is a grandparent without knowing which one.\n\nCompare to how some language don't distinguish between \"sibling\" and \"cousin\", who likewise are different relatives in the same generation. But in an English-speaking context, an ambiguous scenario between the two is unlikely to occur since said kinship always is distinguished. You can't know some one is a sibling/cousin without knowing which. It's the same principle for grandparents in Swedish, they're of the same generation but you always known which. \n\nIf there would be an instance in which you suspect someone might be related to someone, you'd probably just ask if they're the kinship you most suspect, put the alternatives with an \"or\" in the question, or simply ask if they're related. No matter what, the person will likely answer which."}

Around the 50s-70s it was fashionable to perform all operas translated to Swedish (it was the same in Denmark and probably other countries aswell), so there are a lot of recordings available from the Royal Opera in Stockholm with, for example, the great Jussi Bj√∂rling performing all the classics translated to Swedish if you‚Äôre interested. \n\nRegarding original Swedish pieces we don‚Äôt really have many Oratorios in Swedish (I can only think of one of the top of my head: Then Svenska Messan by Johan Helmich Roman), and for getting familiar with the language I would instead recommend our rich library of art songs and choir repertoire.

{"prompt": "can someone fill me in on how to use p√• and att", "completion": "> i thought p√• and att translated to on and that\n\nPrepositions, like the word \"on\", often have dozens of meanings in different contexts. \"On\" in \"on the table\" doesn't mean the same thing as \"on\" in \"The TV is on\" or \"it's on TV tonight\" or \"on Tuesday\" or \"It's so on!\" or \"keep on doing that\" or \"on foot\" or \"on fire\", etc, etc. You shouldn't expect different meanings to be translated into the same word."}
{"prompt": "can someone fill me in on how to use p√• and att", "completion": "> i tried to translate it in my head the use of the two words doesnt make any sense.\n\nThat's because preposition use doesn't map 1:1 between Swedish and your language.\n\nThere are no rules, you just have to memorise when and where to use which preposition. The translations of the prepositions are general guidelines that you can use when you don't know, but you might be wrong."}
{"prompt": "can someone fill me in on how to use p√• and att", "completion": "Note that 'att' has two different functions:\n\n1) as infinitive marker (corresponing to 'to' in English): att g√• = to go.\n\n2) as a subordinator (corresponding to 'that' in English): Han sade att han inte visste = he said that he didn't know."}
{"prompt": "can someone fill me in on how to use p√• and att", "completion": "Another user already explained that \"att\" has two different functions, but also prepositions are usually one of the hardest things to grasp when learning a different language because the usage is often not the same. Where one language might use \"on\" for a given sentence, another would use \"in\" or \"of\", and so on.\n\n\nFor example in Swedish we would say \"vad t√§nker du p√•?\", whereas in English you would say \"what are you thinking of?\" or \"what are you thinking about?\", so you can't really translate word for word and expect it to make sense in your own language."}

{"prompt": "Moving from Estonia to Sweden ‚Äì how hard is Swedish to learn as an Estonian?", "completion": "For accent u can watch a ton of tv now and repeat all the words and sounds and intonations, its called shadowing! \n\nHonestly tho more than any like language learning techniques the most important thing is to make sure you're confident and in a mental state where you can be okay constantly making mistakes for no reason (in that you could basically always speak to ppl here in English but instead you choose to struggle through the rough part of learning a new language). Swedes will switch to English with you and you have to insist on Swedish in as many situations as possible without totally setting you back socially/professionally (like if you cant express ur personality/ability well). \n\nAs soon as you have a decent grasp of the language, try to make some friends who you speak it with from the beginning. Make conversation every time you are in a taxi, often the driver is an immigrant who went through the same experience of learning the language. Honestly the best thing abt learning Swedish has been getting to talk to ppl of a non-Swedish background who I wasn't able to speak with before bc they didn't know English! \n\nOnce you're here, when you are out running errands, pretend you don't know English. Get really used to struggling when its with strangers in relatively straightforward interactions since it doesnt matter at all if you embarrass urself (I mean like at gov't offices or the doctors or anything yeah speak English but I mean like ordering coffee and asking for the bathroom key. also dont like hold up a long line of ppl etc). You should be feeling embarrassed at least once a day for like the first few months you're here. \n\nWhen it comes to making friends, I think it's really important and so I think you can still speak English w people in order to actually get to know each other, but you can transition into Swedish later. You gotta be persistent with it. Like you gotta be ready to be super persistent and expect to have to try like 5 times to speak Swedish w someone before they do. It can help to explain that it makes you feel bad when they switch to English or that you really wanna try speaking even if you struggle. A lot of the switching to English is just to make you comfortable and its often subconscious. \n\nBut yeah these things aren't hard!!!! Its just that no one will force you to learn Swedish so you gotta advocate for urself. Knowing it will absolutely make your life better here. It's a great attitude to go in feeling like you NEED to learn it, and sticking to it. You got this!"}

{"prompt": "Moving from Estonia to Sweden ‚Äì how hard is Swedish to learn as an Estonian?", "completion": "It‚Äôs difficult but since your English is good you are already atleast bilingual or perhaps trilingual (French, German, Spanish, Russian?

Not because we wouldn‚Äôt like you to learn it but because we switch to English (because Swedes are really bilingual and many people are almost fluent in English, my kids at 10 and 15 watch tv,YouTube and videogames and read comics and books in English). Not speaking English is very rare in Sweden. Thus we act like semi-British and pretend like all foreigners must speak English to us. \n\nSo it depends strongly on your ability to find and form friendships with Swedes who communicate with each other in Swedish as this will increase your exposure. \n\nBest of luck though if you move here and try. Lots of swedish speaking immigrants here from all over Europe so you shouldn‚Äôt worry to much. \n\nBut if you pretend that English is hard for you from time to time you might benefit from that."}

My roommate who is american and lives in finland full time said that learning swedish was easier for her.\n\nAs for words and their different flexions or whatever you call them I would suggest just simply learning the whole chain persistently by heart (for example: en bok, boken, b√∂cker, b√∂ckerna).

{"prompt": "Cheap/Free In-Person Swedish Schools in Stockholm", "completion": "Yes it was helpful.

In sfi, I am forced (by situation and myself) to use swedish to communicate. So that's helpful."}
{"prompt": "Learn Swedish with apps or with people?", "completion": "Having learnt a few languages before trying to learn swedish, I think it's a healthy mix of both. It's not really an either/or thing. I don't think apps or even AI can fully replace real conversations. If you're never having conversations with people in that language then I don't think you can ever expect to be fluent. But apps are great tools in the toolbox for vocab on little things here and there."}
{"prompt": "Learn Swedish with apps or with people?", "completion": "You don't learn a new language using Duolingo. It is - or was, before they ditched their translators and started teaching plain incorrect things - decent for expanding your basic vocabulary and practicing what you've already learned.

{"prompt": "The green owl is confusing", "completion": "The FAQ doesn't seem to be accessible to all users at the moment, so I'll post the relevant entry here: \n\n> # ¬ß2 Why is it \"Hon h√∂r mig inte\"? Shouldn‚Äôt inte be before the object?  \n> \r\n> This is a quirk of Swedish (and other languages) called object shift. Object shift means that (non-emphasized) object pronouns are shifted to the left of the sentence adverb unless there's an infinite verb or verb particle in the clause (i.e. if slot 5 is occupied, as per ¬ß1 above). When this word order is available, it's considered normal and unmarked. That means that we say \"Hon h√∂r inte pappa\" but \"Hon h√∂r mig inte\" ‚Äì though it is possible to say \"Hon h√∂r inte mig\".  \n> \r\n> However, we don't say \"Hon h√∂r pappa inte\", because standard nouns can't shift, and we also don't say \"Hon kan mig inte h√∂ra\", because object shift doesn't happen when there's an infinite verb involved. (These word orders are not impossible, but highly unusual out of some specific genres, such as song lyrics.)  \n> \r\n> When the pronoun is emphasized, it can't shift, so leaving it in its \"ordinary\" position could suggest that it is also emphasized. However, keep in mind that this emphasis follows completely different rules than the one that allows something to move to the fundament of a main clause statement."}

Committed students should stick to decent resources like real online dictionaries e.g.  [https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/swedish-english/skillnad](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/swedish-english/skillnad)\n\nI just now tried the newly installed APP again for Swedish, and look at these examples; all wrong.  \nHere is what it says about SKILLNADEN (the difference): \n\n1. I typed the word with a typo SKILNADEN (an l is missing)\n\nIt gives the following sentence with the typo highlighted too: And \"the\" is not highlighted. I quote:  \nVisar **skilnaden** i storlek p√• en axial och radialturbin. Clearly Swedish, and not Norvegian or so. Translates to : Showing the **difference** of an axial and a radial turbine; ref 2.  \n  \nI mean, it's not even good English: must be ...the difference **between** ... sth **and** sth else (not \"of\") or \"an axial versus a radial\"\n\n2. Next I typed it SKILLNADET with the wrong ending -et (skillnad is an -en word) - but it is the valid past participle form. However the example given is again wrong: it says I quote:\n\n... har vi alltid mer gemensamt √§n **skillnadet** => always have more in common than **differences**\n\nShould be \"**skillnader**\" plural. and \"**kommer ifr√•n**\"\n\n=> *\"P√• detta s√§tt f√•r v√•ra elever l√§ra sig att oavsett var m√§nniskor kommer ifr√•n, har vi alltid mer gemensamt √§n skillnader!\"*\n\n3. next I typed SKILLNAD correctly. \n\nIt suggests the indefinite form \"skillnad\", but in the example sentence (with skillnaden) it highlights skillnaden and highlights \"difference\" in the EN translation. It should have highlighted \"the difference\". I quote: \n\nM√•lgrupperna √§r dock den storsta **skillnaden** => The real **difference** is in the target groups.\n\nAlso the \"dock\" isn't translated: correct were: **However**, the target groups are the biggest difference\n\n\\---\n\nThree attempts to use reverso failed to give me correct and complete examples. Even source sentences with typo's in it. **Reason enough to never try it again.** I regret having tried it this time even, after it failed completely on other occasions."}

Otherwise a \"f√∂rl√•t\" works in most situations.\n\nJag m√•r ledsen is not grammatically correct.\n\nGive us some more sentences, and we can help you better üòä"}
{"prompt": "I am sorry vs I am sad", "completion": "No. ‚ÄùJag √§r ledsen‚Äù as an apology is an anglicism. \n\nIn proper Swedish it would be ‚Äúf√∂rl√•t‚Äù. If you want to express sympathy for someone else‚Äôs misfortune, it would be ‚Äújag beklagar‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄùF√∂rl√•t‚Äù can also be used as ‚Äùexcuse me‚Äù."}
{"prompt": "I am sorry vs I am sad", "completion": "Even when you're saying it to apologize, it still really means that you're sad. You're apologizing by declaring that you feel bad about the situation in question. It's usually clear from context if you're saying it to apologize for something or just declaring that you feel sad about something else."}
{"prompt": "I am sorry vs I am sad", "completion": "Jag √§r ledsen is more a sympathy thing. Like someone says ‚ÄùI missed the bus this morning!‚Äù You can say jag √§r ledsen, or det suger. You would not say f√∂rl√•t or ‚Äùsorry‚Äù like in English unless you actually caused them to miss the bus.\n\nAnd if it is something more serious like ‚Äùmy grandma just died‚Äù then you would say jag beklagar which is more like ‚Äùmy condolences‚Äù. Again don‚Äôt say f√∂rl√•t unless you killed their grandma and are apologizing."}
{"prompt": "I am sorry vs I am sad", "completion": "Like another said, \"Jag √§r ledsen att...\" as an apology is not really correct in swedish but I've heard it used in the same way as \"jag beklagar...\" or \"my condolences...\" I recommend you use the latter as to not confuse people and also to be grammatically correct. \n\nBut if you want to say \"i'm sorry,\" you just say \"f√∂rl√•t.\"\n\n\"Jag √§r ledsen f√∂r att...\" means \"I am sad because...\""}
{"prompt": "I am sorry vs I am sad", "completion": "You can not say \"jag m√•r ledsen\" man m√•r d√•ligt eller bra, not really feelings. Man k√§nner sig ledsen, inte m√•r det. \nIf you just say \"jag √§r ledsen\" to someone without anything else people will not understand, unless they already know why you are sad/sorry and you're just clarifying. I don't think we just say \"jag √§r ledsen\", we always explain more. Think we use \"jag beklagar\", more for the you are sorry part and \"jag √§r ledsen\" when it's about your feelings."}
{"prompt": "I am sorry vs I am sad", "completion": "\"Jag ber om urs√§kt\" also works as an apology."}

D√§rf√∂r blir det √§ven naturligt att deras svenska talspr√•k ofta saknar dessa, √§ven om det har ett i √∂vrigt ganska sk√•nskt uttal vad g√§ller spr√•kmelodi och intonation och liknande.

Jag √§r inte s√§ker p√• fonetiken, men m√∂jligen kan man s√§ga att Malm√∂trakten har ett uvulart R-ljud (nere i halsen, som p√• franska) medan Lund, Kristianstad, och flera dialekter fr√•n de omgivande landskapen har ett velart R-ljud (bakre delen av munnen, som p√• tyska).\n\nUt√∂ver det har vi \"P1-sk√•nskan\", s√• kallad f√∂r att den har talats av kulturm√§nniskor p√• radion.

{"prompt": "Will you get weird looks if you speak the Stockholm dialect in G√∂teborg?", "completion": "They won't notice unless your accent is extremely good. You're more likely to have a foreign accent than a Stockholm accent."}
{"prompt": "Will you get weird looks if you speak the Stockholm dialect in G√∂teborg?", "completion": "You will sound foreign and have the accent of your native language moreso than you'll sound like someone from Stockholm. \n\nAs for Gothenburg, nobody will care. It's a large-ish city with people from all over the world, so you won't stand out because of how you speak. Focus on using the language well and learning to express yourself instead of worrying about what Swedish accent you'll end up with."}
{"prompt": "Will you get weird looks if you speak the Stockholm dialect in G√∂teborg?", "completion": "In order for dialect to matter, you have to first pass as a native Swedish speaker, and after four months, that is *extremely* unlikely. No-one is gonna care about your attempts at dialect, because your non-nativeness is gonna shine through 100x stronger."}
{"prompt": "Will you get weird looks if you speak the Stockholm dialect in G√∂teborg?", "completion": "I think you're vastly overestimating your own abilities if you've been studying Swedish for 4 months and believe you already are at the level where you will have a discernable regional accent.\n\nIt will take years of studying any language to get past the point of sounding like a child with a heavy twang from your native language.\n\nYou will sound nothing but German to Swedish people.

{"prompt": "Will you get weird looks if you speak the Stockholm dialect in G√∂teborg?", "completion": "If your Swedish is good enough after 4 months that your accent is identifiable as being more Stockholm than G√∂teborg then people will just be impressed.\n\nOnce in G√∂teborg you‚Äôll adapt to how people around you speak."}

{"prompt": "Will you get weird looks if you speak the Stockholm dialect in G√∂teborg?", "completion": "No. The Stockholm dialect is largely overlapping with \"rikssvenska\" which is \"standard Swedish\". There's no reason anyone would be mad.\n\nAlso, I doubt you're speaking a specific dialect of Swedish because the differences between them are all relatively small barring general *tone* of speech. To speak as one from Stockholm, you first must get confident in the language and you don't really \"learn\" dialects - you pick them up."}
{"prompt": "Will you get weird looks if you speak the Stockholm dialect in G√∂teborg?", "completion": "As the others have said, it is very hard (if not impossible) to learn Swedish at such a level that your primary dialect is not a foreign accent but rather a Stockholm or Gothenburg one.

{"prompt": "Vart bor du?", "completion": "I consider that as (one of) the Swedish equivalent of not knowing the difference of then and than in English...

{"prompt": "is h√•lla means hold or agree", "completion": "It's a partikelverb. Two words make a whole with a different meaning. Just like \"pass away\" in english means to die and not to simply pass by in an away-direction.\n\nEdit: we have tons of them in swedish. They're fun to learn and more often than not very opaque. One thing you need to remember is that you always need to put emphasis on the second word, or it wont become a partikelverb and won't carry the same meaning. Examples: komma till, somna in, hitta p√•, sl√• till, tr√§ffa p√•, sl√• in. Without emphasis on the second word the words will just carry their litteral and obvious meaning."}

{"prompt": "HejÔºÅ I start to learn Swedish right now", "completion": ">In Sweden, everyone can make a tongue trillÔºü Would it change meaning of a word if I don't do that?\n\nThe R sound is pronounced differently depending on where you are in Sweden. In some places they hardly pronounce it at all. You won't change the meaning of a word by pronouncing it differently, as long as it is recognizable as an R sound."}
{"prompt": "HejÔºÅ I start to learn Swedish right now", "completion": "Some words are close to being the same and others are not close at all. For example, \"cat\" in English is \"katt\" in Swedish. \"Dog\" is \"hund\" (close to the English \"hound\"). But others are not close at all, like \"moose\" is \"√§lg\" in Swedish.\n\nOne of the hardest things people have a hard time with is when to use \"en\" vs \"ett\". English does not have gendered nouns, but Swedish does. There really is no rule to when to use which like English has with \"a\" vs \"an\". You have to know which to use in Swedish.\n\nAnd the tongue trill? I haven't heard of it changing the meaning of a word if you don't do it. You probably will just come off as speaking with an accent."}
{"prompt": "HejÔºÅ I start to learn Swedish right now", "completion": "1. Yes, that's true. There are a lot of similarities. Some words are even the same.\n2. No, not really. The grammar is the tricky bit. You say a lot of things \"backwards\" in Swedish compared to English. There are a lot of rules that don't really have a reason and that you \"just have to know\".\n3. I think all native speakers can, yes. I am native English and can't do the trill, haha."}
{"prompt": "HejÔºÅ I start to learn Swedish right now", "completion": "Most Swedish words are very different from English ones, there are more common ones but only really the simplest words. Grammar also isn't very similar. But Swedish is easier than most other languages for English speakers because the differences are greater if you compare English and Polish for example. Is it \"easy\"? I doubt it. Learning any language isn't \"easy\" it still takes time and effort. A language being the \"easiest\" to learn doesn't make learning languages easy in general"}
{"prompt": "HejÔºÅ I start to learn Swedish right now", "completion": ">In Sweden, everyone can make a tongue trillÔºü\n\nPretty much (though I had that one childhood friend with a speech impediment‚Ä¶)\n\n>Would it change meaning of a word if I don't do that?\n\nNo. There's no sound to confuse with an 'un-trilled' R. In fact, some dialects pronounce the letter R not as the typical trilled /r/ sound but instead a 'Parisian' uvular R / Å/. If you use an 'English' rhotic R /…π/, people will immediately identify you as a non-native speaker, but they will not have any problem understanding you. When I grew up, I had some friends whose parents were native English speakers and who never picked up the /r/ sound in spite of otherwise fluent Swedish. They never had any problems therefrom that I'm aware of."}
{"prompt": "HejÔºÅ I start to learn Swedish right now", "completion": "1. It‚Äôs somewhat easier to learn since there are some similarities. Swedish and English are related. \n\n2. Some words are similar, English has borrowed words from Swedish way back, and Swedish has borrowed some words from English. Both languages have also borrowed words from French and German for example. But sometimes words are really similar or identical but mean wildly different things. Some grammar is different. But I guess our grammar is closer than languages from completely different parts of the world. \n\n3. Most Swedish accents roll their Rs, I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs what you mean. (Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.) not all accents do, and you will still be understood. Maybe some people will need a moment to ‚Äúdecode‚Äù your accent but you should be fine."}

{"prompt": "Question for people learning Swedish about combineed words with prefix", "completion": "Native speaker, but too interesting to skip:\n\nFirst, I think the prefix fram- is an exception. It would correspond to something like pre- or up- that have been used for centuries and are deeply embedded in the language.\n\nIn many ways, the number and length of compounded words is a theoretical construct more than a practical property of the language.\n\n[Wikipedia writes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_(linguistics)):\n\n>As a member of the Germanic family of languages, English is unusual in that even simple compounds made since the 18th century tend to be written in separate parts. This would be an error in other Germanic languages such as Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, German, and Dutch. However, this is merely an orthographic convention: as in other Germanic languages, arbitrary noun phrases, for example \"girl scout troop\", \"city council member\", and \"cellar door\", can be made up on the spot and used as compound nouns in English too.\n\n>For example, German Donau¬≠dampfschifffahrts¬≠gesellschafts¬≠kapit√§n[a] would be written in English as \"Danube steamship transport company captain\" and not as \"Danube¬≠steamship¬≠transportcompany¬≠captain\".\n\nThe \"worlds longest word\" videos you can easily find are theoretical constructs with absolutely no practical meaning. Regardless of the claims, such words have never been used in practice. Nearly infinite word chains can be as easily constructed in Swedish as in Norwegian or German. These languages are called ~~[agglutinative](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutinative_language).~~ EDIT: they are [fusional](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusional_language). Similarly, agglutination is the main reason for the false statement \"Inuit has a [thousand words for snow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskimo_words_for_snow)\".\n\n(Fun fact: long distance (touring) skaters collected words in Swedish for describing ice and the list exceeded 1300 words when I last saw it. Almost all of them were compounded, eg apelsinskalsis.)\n\nWe just happen to not use spaces when compounding words, but most languages do.\n\nIt doesn't really make the learning/language harder or easier if the word is \"table legs\" or \"tablelegs\"."}
{"prompt": "Question for people learning Swedish about combineed words with prefix", "completion": "Swedish is my second language.\n\nIME the frequency of words that share common parts only sometimes makes it easier to accurately guess the meanings of words where you have seen one of the parts before, and that's not always guaranteed. It doesn't really make vocabulary easier or harder to learn. \n\nIn terms of learning vocabulary, I find it harder to build consistent recall for words like \"avg√∂ra\" and \"anf√∂ra\" out of context due to their relatively close visual similarity (despite being made of all different parts) more often than words like \"framtid\" and \"framf√∂r\".\n\nI think it helps to learn words, compound or otherwise, as self contained units. A word like \"framtid\" is of course made up of the parts \"fram\" and \"tid\" but \"framtid\" is itself a word that stands on its own. Words like \"f√∂rh√•llande\" which aren't compounds at all can't be learned by knowing the meanings of \"f√∂r\", \"h√•ll\", and \"ande\".\n\nIMO recognizing compound words is useful for guessing, but not really for learning."}
{"prompt": "Question for people learning Swedish about combineed words with prefix", "completion": "Native speaker.\n\n\nMy personal opinion ‚Äì and experience from English ‚Äì is that compounds make things easier.\n\n\nTake the word \"future/*framtid*\" for example:\n\n\n* English ‚Äì from Latin *futurus*.\n\n\n* Swedsh ‚Äì compound of *fram* (\"forward\") + *tid* (\"time\").\n\n\nThere are however a few words that can confuse you, often because they have started to carry new meanings.\n\n\nFor example \"parliament/*riksdag*\":\n\n\n* English ‚Äì from French compound *parler* (‚Äúto speak‚Äù) + -ment (verb‚Üínoun).\n\n\n* Swedish ‚Äì compound of *rike* (\"realm\") + *dag* (\"day\"), from the historical praxis of local chiefs to take a day of the month/year to meet and discuss matters of the larger realm."}

{"prompt": "What methods have you found most effective in learning Swedish?", "completion": "I‚Äôll second the recommendation for finding someone to speak with besides your girlfriend.  The most useful thing for me was working one on one with a tutor.  I tried classes but they went too slow and didn‚Äôt really cover what mattered to me.  A good tutor will figure out your learning style, strengths and weaknesses and tailor a curriculum to meet your needs.  I found a tutor through our local chapter of SWEA.\n\nI was lucky to make a Swedish friend early on in the learning process.  We had a deal where we would go to a pub after work Friday afternoons.  I would buy beer and then we would just speak Swedish for a couple hours.  I‚Äôm convinced to this day that the beer helped a great deal.\n\nI use the SAOL app a lot so I‚Äôd recommend that.  SR (Sveriges Radio) and SVT have news programs in ‚Äúeasy Swedish‚Äù that are good once you‚Äôve got some vocabulary under your belt.  I got in the habit of listening to them daily as well as reading digital Dagens Nyheter daily.\n\nI don‚Äôt have a specific one to recommend but having a book of Swedish grammar to use as a resource is important.  A tutor may help you with that.  There are things about the language that didn‚Äôt make any sense to me until I learned the grammatical ‚Äúrule‚Äù."}

Obviously that‚Äôs not interesting/possible for a lot of people, but I think there relevant aspects. As well as the immersion of being in a group I only spoke Swedish with, i think it helped me that the focus was on something other than language learning, and also that I was learning something I didn‚Äôt have the language to talk about in English, so I had nothing to fall back on. Also that it was something practical, with tools, meant that I could always point to things and ask ‚Äùwhat‚Äôs this‚Äù."}
{"prompt": "What methods have you found most effective in learning Swedish?", "completion": "Quite simply, by talking it non-stop. Letting people know you want them to correct you. If you can't say something in Swedish try explaining what you want to say in Swedish to get told the answer. If that doesn't work then say it in English, have them tell you what to say then say it.\n\nRepeat, repeat and repeat."}

{"prompt": "Why is this example using ‚Äúhon‚Äù instead of ‚Äúdet‚Äù?", "completion": "Swedish used to have three genders. Feminine merged into masculine, but the resulting \"common\" gender uses 'den', not 'he'. Most genuine dialects have three genders, but when dialects speaking communities transition over to two, they tend to use 'he' for everything, but the standard language uses 'den'. The usage of 'den' as anything but a demonstrative is a medieval innovation probably originating in western Denmark, then spreading to swedish upper class slowly. \n\nFor most words you just have to know whether they are 'den' or 'det', with 3 genders of course wherher they are 'han', 'hon' or 'det'. The usage of common gender reached so called 'weak' nouns last, those ending in -e or -a in the indefinite singular. All ending in -e were masculine, all ending in -a were feminine, so it was very easy to know which were which. You could rarely guess for 'strong' nouns like bj√∂rk, asp, sax, d√∂rr, sj√§l that they were hon-words, and likewise not that kniv, kropp, mat and b√•t that they were han-words. Klockan being hon in this set expression is just a rest of this old system, where 'den' like we know it didn't exist, and han/hon were used in it's stead."}

It has two excellent teachers, that I would personally recommend.)\n\n*Not living in Sweden and don't have much money? Try some free language learning apps like *Duolingo* just to get a feel for the language. Look for easy Swedish videos on YouTube. Start at the beginning with alphabet videos. It might seem too basic, but it will help you with your pronunciation. The *Fun Swedish* channel is good for beginners.\nIf you're looking for text books, try *Rivstart A1*. If you think you can manage to be taught in English, the book *Complete Swedish* is a great all-round resource."}

{"prompt": "Correct term for \"escapee\" in Swedish", "completion": "Both essentially do the job. \n\n\"Flykting\" carries a connotation of fleeing from a catastrophic situation, like a war or natural disaster. \"Rymling\" is more like having escaped from a prison or some other place where you're mandated to remain. \n\nI guess it depends on how you want to speak about IKEA."}

{"prompt": "How do you pronounce \"Bror\"?", "completion": "It's similar to the \"oo\" in \"Google\". The first r is rolled and the second is like an English r."}
{"prompt": "How do you pronounce \"Bror\"?", "completion": ">It always comes out messy, usually more like \"Brewer\".\n\nI assume this means you're struggling with your Rs. Assuming you're a native English-speaker, you need to learn to change your tongue position so you can start pronouncing your Rs properly.\n\nThe English R is pronounced with the tongue curled back in the mouth or with the tip pointed down and the bulk of the tongue pushed up. The Swedish (and practically all other languages) R is pronounced with the tip of the tongue placed at the palate just behind your front teeth. Unlike the English-R which comes from the throat, the Swedish-R sound comes from air passing over the tongue and making the tip of the tongue trill against the palate.\n\nTry saying 'bdoud' or 'bloul' or 'bsjosj' and your tongue will be better placed for transitioning to a Swedish R-sound."}

Birger has a spotify podcast channel, free for a great deal, and one is about speaking. \n\nWhy not take an all free approach, such as with DL, ...you will be skipping too easily, as it costs you nothing.\n\nGo for a commitment that costs you money if you skip.\n\nA lot of listening, even if you don't understand it all in the beginning, is a must to get the overall tone and rythm of Swedish.. you'll mimic afterwards without even noticing.\n\nYou should absolutely minimize the use of AI or other computer based tools, as this paralyzes your brain. The key to learning and memorizing is actively doing thing all by yourself, like speaking, writing down words and phrases and example sentences by hand, and reading them out loud.\n\nYou can however let AI create your own lesson material, if you use that to actively work on it. Learning words just by takibg an anki deck isn't enough. Yiu should actively make sentences, and have them corrected here or on the  duome forrum.\n\nWriting a daily log of what you did, or what you plan to do, forces you in a daily rythm and commitment, and it will lead you to use your own words.

{"prompt": "i tisdags vs. p√• tisdagen vs. p√• tisdag", "completion": "If you only talk about when you bought the car without a continuous chain of events, you use \"i tisdags\". For example, someone asks you if you did anything interesting the past days and you say: \"I tisdags k√∂pte jag en ny bil\", or: \"Min gamla bil gick s√∂nder f√∂r n√•gra dagar sedan, s√• jag k√∂pte en ny bil i tisdags/s√• i tisdags k√∂pte jag en ny bil\".\n\nIf you want to tell a more detailed story with more days, it can be nice to change it to \"p√• tisdagen\". For example, you tell someone that you bought a car last week: \"I m√•ndags f√∂rra veckan gick min bil s√∂nder. Det var stressigt d√• jag beh√∂vde bil f√∂r att kunna ta mig till jobbet p√• onsdagen. Jag hittade snabbt en ny bil via annons p√• Blocket och redan p√• tisdagen hade jag k√∂pt den, s√• jag missade inga jobbdagar.\" You can even use it in a longer timeframe: \"I m√•ndags/P√• m√•ndagen f√∂r tv√• veckor sedan fick jag motorstopp och bilen ville inte starta efter det. B√§rgbilen fick ta den till verkstaden, men efter n√•gra dagar meddelade de att det inte gick att fixa felet, s√• jag beh√∂vde skrota bilen.

P√• tisdagen veckan efter hittade jag √§ntligen bilen jag letat efter och k√∂pte den s√• fort jag s√•g den!\"\n\n\"P√• tisdag\" is about the future (\"P√• tisdag n√§sta vecka/om X veckor/den femte augusti). It can (incorrectly) also be for further back in time at a specific date (\"p√• tisdag den tredje juni\"), but it is better/more correct to use \"p√• tisdagen\" for that (\"p√• tisdagen den tredje juni\" / \"den tredje juni, en tisdag, √•kte vi till stranden\")"}
{"prompt": "i tisdags vs. p√• tisdagen vs. p√• tisdag", "completion": "\"I tisdags\" is the normal way to express \"on \\[last = closest preceding\\] Tuesday\". \"P√• tisdagen\" is grammatically correct, but sounds odd.

{"prompt": "i tisdags vs. p√• tisdagen vs. p√• tisdag", "completion": "\"I tisdags\" is last Tuesday, specifically. So you might say \"I tisdags h√§nde x\" anytime between like...

So you'd say \"p√• tisdag kommer x h√§nda\" from Tuesday of the week before to like... Sunday the week before (Monday would be \"imorgon kommer x h√§nda\").\n\n\"p√• tisdagen\" is a specific Tuesday that's not \"directly adjoining to now\" or what to call it. It could be \"tisdagen innan julafton h√§nde x\" (x happened on the Tuesday before Christmas eve), or even \"jag s√•g avsnittet tisdagen efter det sl√§pptes\" (I watched the episode the Tuesday after it was released). In order to use \"p√• tisdagen\" a time frame must be specified, though. So in the examples, if you're talking about Christmas eve, or when a certain episode dropped that *might* be omitted, because the time frame is already stated, or you state it in conjunction to the statement itself. Like in the examples. With \"p√• tisdag\" and \"i tisdags\" the time frame is always relating to \"now\"."}

It took me at least 2 ¬†months to recognize when my Swedish SFI teacher was asking a question vs saying a statement.\n\nOne day, in class, I finally recognized something she said for the very first time. She was asking some simple, basic question to the class and we were all sitting there like, ‚ÄúDuuuuur, what?‚Äù üòÖ but my eyes opened wide and I said, ‚ÄúOh! Du fr√•gade en sak!‚Äù I was so excited to finally realize how to hear a question vs a statement.\n\nI observed and watched my Swedish boyfriend‚Äôs niece and nephew and I was fascinated that they were able to instantly tell if someone was asking them something or telling them something.¬†\n\nI realized that in English, I was used to listening for the tone to go UP at the end of a sentence, as a cue that someone is asking me something.¬†Example: ‚ÄúShe went out like that?‚Äù vs ‚ÄúShe went out like that.‚Äù The first one is likely to have a raised tone, at least in American English.\n\nBut in Swedish, they don‚Äôt necessarily go up like that. I had to train my ears to listen for the first word in the sentence. Har du‚Ä¶? Vill du‚Ä¶? Kan ni‚Ä¶? Osv.\n\nYou‚Äôll get used to it. Just keep listening. You‚Äôll get the hang of it!"}
{"prompt": "Duolingo interrogative stress and intonation", "completion": "I don't think it's correct, even the way it pronounces words seems off, it cannot figure out how to pronounce \"l√§r\" and the way it says \"√§r\" is completely different than what I have heard come out of real people's mouths. The way it stresses words like \"det\" (iirc) sounds really unnatural even in Duolingo. I know you asked more about how sentences are stressed but I think it still applies. I have noticed the full sentences it reads out flow a little better, but when you have to structure the sentence yourself and click on every word it sounds like I'm using a kids toy lol.. either way I feel it is not how people actually talk, it would be like if people talked like the tiktok TTS I think"}
{"prompt": "Duolingo interrogative stress and intonation", "completion": "Thank you for replying! I was beginning to think my question had either come across as rude or nobody in the entire sub has ever considered how a question sounds.\nAfter I posted, I started thinking about questions in English and how they don't necessarily sound how one might at first think. For instance: \"How *tall* are you?\", What is *that* for?\", \"Is that *green*?\" They all have very different stresses and I couldn't for the life of me describe a rule for how an English question sounds."}
{"prompt": "Duolingo interrogative stress and intonation", "completion": "I thought the same about **√§r** but, as a beginner, presumed it must be some dialectical thing.

The sentence itself is correct though.\n\n\n**Det √§r inte aktuellt att vidta n√•gra √•tg√§rder, It is not necessary to take any action**\n\nIt only means that no measures will be taken. They probably would be thrilled if people interpret it as that no measures are necessary, but the sentence only means that no measures will be taken. Often politicians, companies or other institutions use that kind of phrasing when people do think it‚Äôs crucial and essential to do something, but those in charge anyway have decided no measures will be taken. For example to to too high costs or other priorities.

{"prompt": "\"Oskyldig\" flicka", "completion": "It sure sounds like he is referring to whether she is a \"virigin\" or not, yeah.\n\nOnly reason I say this is purely based on context, the fact that he asks whether she will be mad, asks it in a \"nervous\" manner, and so on.\n\nThe correct word for this nowadays in normal & direct conversations would rather be \"oskuld\", not \"oskyldig\". As the usage of \"oskyldig\" can only be understood as \"virgin\" based on actual context, tension, and so on. The general translation for \"oskyldig\" would be \"innocent\", yeah."}

{"prompt": "Am I watching/listening to media the right way?", "completion": "Any listening is going to help as long as you are trying to understand it (i.e. paying attention) and succeeding some of the time.

An easier alternative would be something made for language learners. There are several good Youtube channels and podcasts. \n\nBut it's very personal, you have to also factor in what you're going to enjoy. I would say if you are understanding the kids shows and making progress then that will work just fine. A tip you could use if those are still difficult is to rewatch episodes and see if you can understand more."}

I got the book TEACH YOURSELF SWEDISH, by RJ McClean, and read as much as I could about the grammar. Since none of the Swedish people I knew had a good knowledge of grammar, I figured out things by asking questions a lot. I wrote down my questions and the answers in a notebook I always had with me. I could manage simple conversations in about 3 months, but fluency took 2 years. By that I mean that I didn't have to translate things in my head anymore before speaking, and I could read and write, without hesitation. The conjugation of verbs is so easy compared to Spanish, which I knew a bit of before I went. I learned the past, present, and future forms of 10 verbs at a time. That is only 30 words! One word for each tense. I learned nouns as I needed them, and pronouns. The pronunciation can be hard for English speakers from the US and England.

It feels too much like forcing people to speak Swedish with me when I don't have that much to offer yet, and like I'm expecting them to do me a favour. I actually did find a couple of people willing to speak Swedish with me (blending it with English), but these interactions are too few and far between."}
{"prompt": "How to improve my talking skills", "completion": "Three ideas:\n\n* Use your hobbies. Join a f√∂rening for something that seems interesting or take a kv√§llskurs in something that just seems fun. Those are reliable ways to find people to talk to.\n\n* Try to use more Swedish at work. Talk to your colleagues about the situation, and that it really benefits everyone if you can improve your speaking skills. Don‚Äôt overdo it, but agree on some small time or activity where it‚Äôs ok for them to slow down and use Swedish. \n\n* Try listening to the radio. Listening a lot helps you getting the feeling for the language. If you understand what people say, it‚Äôs much easier to interact, even if you have a hard time phrasing things swiftly.  There are news in l√§tt svenska, and in the SR app, if you listen to P1 sommar without the music, and some other programs, you can get a transcript that you can read while listening and also pause. You find it in the settings while playing the program. \n\nAlso don‚Äôt forget to be very proud of having improved reading and writing. It‚Äôs definitely valuable and a necessary foundation for your speech."}
{"prompt": "How to improve my talking skills", "completion": "I had issues aswell with outputting Swedish, reading was fine, but writing and speaking, I had issues coming up with sentences. One easy thing that helped me getting this more fluent, in my case it was writing at first, was playing small games with ChatGPT. Like having a conversation with it, it gives me a small text then ask me open questions on it, it talks to me in English and I need to answer in Swedish, etc. Anything that would force me to come up spontaneously with things to say. One good thing is that you can also do all of that by talking to ChatGPT instead of writing."}

{"prompt": "Brandgul ‚ÄúFire Yellow‚Äù vs Orange", "completion": "Yes, *brandgul* used to be a common name for orange.¬†\n\n\nWhile I wasn't alive during most of the 20th century, I did some quick research.¬†\n\n\n\nFirst I checked the dictionary ‚Äì *[brandgul](https://svenska.se/tre/?sok=brandgul&pz=2)* was first attested in 1532 and *[orange](https://svenska.se/tre/?sok=orange&pz=2)* was first attested in 1654. So we definitely had both terms in the 20th century.¬†\n\n\nSecondly I checked the newspaper archive. In year 1950 *[brangul](https://tidningar.kb.se/search?q=Brandgul&searchGranularity=part)* was mentioned 46 times, while *[orange](https://tidningar.kb.se/search?q=Orange%20&searchGranularity=part)* was mentioned 762 times. In year 1900 it was *brandgul* 97 times and *orange* 1393 times.\n\n\nSoo... If his mother did read the newspaper, she would most certainly know of the term *orange*. But if she had a rural upbringing, it's quite possible that her family didn't use fancy words like *orange*, and just stuck with the unambiguous *brandgul*."}
{"prompt": "Brandgul ‚ÄúFire Yellow‚Äù vs Orange", "completion": "I was taught in school (in the early 90s) to use brandgul instead of orange in order to get around the conjugation problem (‚Äùorange:t‚Äù?)."}
{"prompt": "Brandgul ‚ÄúFire Yellow‚Äù vs Orange", "completion": "The word orange has been used in Swedish since the late 18th century, but up until the mid-20th century, brandgul (literally \"fire-yellow\") was the more common term. Today, orange has become completely dominant.\n\nOne theory is that this shift began with advertising, especially clothing ads. Brandgul is a poetic word, well-suited for describing autumn leaves and sunsets, but perhaps not a color people wanted to associate with their clothing."}
{"prompt": "Brandgul ‚ÄúFire Yellow‚Äù vs Orange", "completion": "Wow, I had no idea it was originally the word for orange. I still use it once in a while, just to switch up my vocabulary. Sometimes it simply sounds better or more appropriate to say brandgul than orange."}

We can at least see that *orange* becomes considerably more common after 1900. There's a big peak in the 1970s, but that seems to apply equally to all colour terms ‚Äì I'm guessing it's to do with ads, but you can investigate it if you're interested.\n\n(Oh, and if you're talking about Homer's \"wine-coloured sea\" and \"copper sky\", that might be a misunderstanding, but maybe that's a little off-topic here.)"}

{"prompt": "How to improve my Swedish when I don‚Äôt understand native speakers at work?", "completion": "Have you acquired a second language as an adult before? You already know a Germanic language (English), but just using self learning techniques is likely going to be very challenging, unless you already have some experience going down that route.\n\nI am a native Swedish speaker, so I dont have personal experience learning the language, but I have studied about six other languages, with fluency in four. So, my first advice - attend classes. Make use of professional teachers who adapt their language to your level, as you get accustomed to how the language actually sounds and works on practice. Language learning apps tend to teach you how words and phrases sound in isolation, but dont give good practice for parsing natural speech.\n\nAlso, especially learning Swedish it might pay off to study phonetics a bit - as in the science of how language sounds are produced, distinguished and contrasted in languages. Learning to interpret the phonetic alphabet and decode how different vowels are pronounced in particular help with a language like Swedish with many rare soubds. It can be quite useful to understand the differences between dialects etc., before your decoding of speech is automated. \n\nOtherwise, I find podcasts to be a good medium for practicing more conversational language comprehension. You can often find Swedish podcasts concerned with topics you are interested in and familiar with, and some will be easier to understand. You can also slow them down and sometimes get transcripts to help. For this to be meaningful you should at least be able to browse using Swedish only, and understand most or all the sentences in a podcast or episode description."}

{"prompt": "Is this a good strategy?", "completion": "What's your native language? I don't really understand how fluency in German may help a native English speaker. Both are Western Germanic languages, and the Nordic languages belong to the Northern Germanic family. Of all WGmc languages, English historically has had the greatest Norse influence, to the point of becoming the odd one out in the whole family. Old English arose from the older Anglo-Saxon Sprachbund in Britain at the time of ‚Äî¬†if not as the result of ‚Äî very close language contact with the Old Norse. Both Swedish and English have much more French borrowings than German, albeit by very different routes and to a different degree. There are more Swedish words whose meaning an English speaker may guess than a German speaker can. And the grammar is not too complex, and perhaps equally different from English and German.\n\nWhat do you mean by \"learning\" Swedish? There are 4 areas in the language acquisition: listening, production, reading and writing. By watching, pardon my French, \"content\" you are taking care of only one aspect of the four, listening, which is tightly coupled to production which you don't practice. In isolation, this hardly takes you to any sensible end I can think of.\n\nAlso, depending on the type of \"content\", you're acquiring a specific register. A play set in the 19th¬†c. uses a very different language than the news. You can hardly acquire modern colloquial language even from a podcast. If you're gearing for an exchange, colloquial language is essential. Find a native speaker who's willing to correct you. There are services on the internet where you may find a tutor for a pretty low hourly pay.\n\nA good strategy is the one that works for you. I could never remember flashcards, to the point I could never learn the cardinals 1 to 10. Personally, being immersed in the language-speaking community or reading and writing, depending on my goal, has been the best strategy ‚Äê¬†_to me._ But some people learn by rote just fine. Experiment. Try different things and see what works and what doesn't."}

{"prompt": "Klockan √§r efter 21.00.  Aff√§ren har knappast √∂ppet nu.", "completion": "The other answers aren‚Äôt quite right.\n\n‚ÄùHar √∂ppet‚Äù in this case differs from ‚Äù√§r √∂ppen‚Äù by putting the emphasis on the habitual ‚Äùbehavior‚Äù of the store, ie open hours, rather than the concrete fact of whether they are open or not at this time.\n\n(Note that ‚ÄùHar √∂ppnat‚Äù is a separate case, putting the emphasis on whether an expected event has happened)\n\nSo ‚Äùhar √∂ppet‚Äù would be preferred in situations where we talk about when the store is open *in general*, while ‚Äù√§r √∂ppen‚Äù is used when asking about the concrete fact of whether they are open right now.\n\nSo in this case when they‚Äôre saying ‚Äùhar knappast √∂ppet nu‚Äù they‚Äôre really saying ‚Äùhar knappast √∂ppet den h√§r tiden p√• dygnet‚Äù / ‚Äùthey‚Äôre hardly open this time of the day‚Äù, this is implicit because they just referred to the time of the day. So they‚Äôre saying ‚Äùsince it‚Äôs 9pm, we‚Äôre likely outside the usual open hours of the store‚Äù, making ‚Äùhar √∂ppet‚Äù the right choice. They‚Äôre referring to shared knowledge of usual open hours.\n\nOn the other hand if it was currently within open hours, let‚Äôs say 3pm, but you had first hand knowledge that it happens to be closed right now, it would be wrong to say ‚Äùaff√§ren har inte √∂ppet nu‚Äù, you have to say ‚Äùaff√§ren √§r inte √∂ppen nu‚Äù because you‚Äôre referring to this concrete instance rather than the general open hours.\n\nIn the morning, it would be most common to say ‚Äùde har nog inte √∂ppnat √§n‚Äù - this is the ‚Äùhar √∂ppnat‚Äù (expected event) usage not the ‚Äùhar √∂ppet‚Äù (general open hours) usage. You‚Äôre referring to the shared expectation that the store will open some time this morning, adding your belief that tips event hasn‚Äôt occurred yet. It would be slightly weird to say ‚Äùde har knappast √∂ppnat √§n‚Äù, and slightly annoying to say ‚Äùde har inte √∂ppet nu‚Äù ( you would likely get the reply ‚Äùvad√•, har de inte √∂ppnat √§n?

{"prompt": "the inconsistent usages of en and ett in sweden", "completion": "First of all, there's a big difference between 'kaffe' (coffee) and 'kaf√©' (coffee shop). Both are 'ett' words, but when people say 'en kaffe,' it's because it's really 'en kopp kaffe' (a cup of coffee), but they're leaving out the cup portion.\n\nAs far as 'mejl' goes, that's a relatively recent loanword, which is why it is inconsistent."}
{"prompt": "the inconsistent usages of en and ett in sweden", "completion": "First of all kaffe and kaf√© are not the same word, the former means coffee, the latter means caf√©. If a neuter noun (ett) ends in a stressed vowel, its plural form will be -er as if it were common (en). The singular definite form is regularly kaf√©et but reduced to kaf√©t colloquially. Kaffe is neutered if uncountable but common if countable although its plural is identical.\n\nMejl is neuter if means the message but common if means the address."}
{"prompt": "the inconsistent usages of en and ett in sweden", "completion": "Kaffe and kaf√© are not the same word.\n\nEn kaffe is a cup/mug of coffee. (what you order).\n\nEtt kaf√© is an establishment that serves coffee and light food items.\n\nThe mail thing is just wrong imo. Ett mejl √§r mottaget, not mottagen.\n\nYou can receive en mejlkonversation or mejltr√•d but that's because the gender is defined by the latest word in a compound word.\n\nYou have en mejladress but ett mejlkonto. \n\nSometimes, the attached word in a compound is omited, which makes things a bit difficult, but this is context related and just something one will learn with time."}
{"prompt": "the inconsistent usages of en and ett in sweden", "completion": "My two cents: \"mottaget mejl\" would have sounded like we're talking about one piece of received correspondence.

{"prompt": "Frustrated!", "completion": ">How I can I boost my vocabulary?\n\nDet enklaste s√§ttet √§r att bara l√§sa. Det finns n√•got som kallas f√∂r \"parallel reading\" och det betyder att man l√§ser n√•got man har bra kunskap p√• men man l√§ser det p√• ett fr√§mmande spr√•k. T.ex. Du √§r amerikan s√• du antagligen har ganska bra kunskap p√• USA. \n\nN√§r du l√§ser Wikipedia-artikeln om USA: https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA\n\ns√• finns det antagligen n√•gra ord i artikeln som du inte sett f√∂rut. Men din kunskap om √§mnet kan hj√§lpa dig att gissa dessa ords betydelse. Med det h√§r s√§ttet s√• exponeras du f√∂r m√•nga nya ord. En f√∂rdel med denna metod √§r att du l√§r dig dessa ord med kontext. \n\n>I want to describe things in detail\n\nKontext √§r, som sagt, viktigt. Man borde alltid l√§ra sig nya ord med kontext.  Att overs√§tta enskilda ord fr√•n engelska till svenska kan f√• en att dra fel slutsatser av ett ords betydelse. \n\nMan borde ocks√• t√§nka p√• andra ord som kan f√∂rknippas med m√•lordet. T.ex. Man har l√§rt sig att \"knife\" heter \"kniv\" p√• svenska. Men det finns m√•nga andra ord som f√∂rknippas med \"kniv\". Man kan s√§ga att en kniv √§r *vass*. Man kan *sk√§ra* n√•got, eller *hugga* n√•gon med en kniv. \n\nN√§r man har f√∂rb√§ttrat sitt ordf√∂rr√•d s√• blir det mycket l√§ttare att f√∂rb√§ttra ens h√∂rf√∂rst√•else. Jag rekommenderar att man tittar p√• svenska filmer som ocks√• har svenska undertexter. Det kan hj√§lpa att skapa ett samband mellan uttalet och stavningen.

These words are also outside of the 2000 most common words: ...kniv, vass, sk√§ra and hugga.\n\nSince the knife-words were an example, I won't count them. So out of my 255-word post, there are only 10 words that are outside the 2000 most common words and, even then, \"amerikan\" and \"kontext\" should be pretty easy to guess; \"uttal\" and \"stavning\" should be a basic part of a language learner's vocab. So there are only 6 words above that should be new to an A2 speaker."}

The exception is when saying \"ett IKEA-varuhus\" (an IKEA store), but that's because \"varuhus\" is an ETT word, and it's unrelated to the included name.\n\nThe rule of thumb for using EN/ETT is decided by the forms of the word;   \n\\- The indefinite article: *en* katt (a cat) - *ett* √§pple (an apple)  \n\\- The definite form: katt*en* (the cat) - √§ppl*et* (the apple)\n\nAs you can see, where *EN* is used, it is because the definite form ends with *-EN*, and where *ETT* is used, it's because the definite form ends with *-ET*. \n\nHope this helps!"}

{"prompt": "When the plural changes basic spelling", "completion": "Endings -er, -el, -en in stems of nouns (√•ker, f√•gel, vatten) are often underlyingly -r, -l, -n (so the older forms of these words were more like √•kr, f√•gl, vattn, and the -e- is just epenthetic, added for ease of pronunciation). \n\nIn fact, this is still reflected in the pitch accent, with a word like f√•gel having the first accent like monosyllabic words (as opposed to the second accent which would normally be expected from stems with more syllables after the first one). \n\nOf course, this may not be the most immediately useful information for a learner since pitch accent is not indicated in writing."}

{"prompt": "P√•se v Kasse", "completion": "There are a lot of nuances to this. In my mind a kasse always has handles, while a p√•se may or may not have handles. A p√•se is often smaller than a kasse, but not always.\n\nThe usage of the bag also matters. A plastic matkasse becomes a sopp√•se when you have carried your groceries home and reuse the bag to hold your household trash, even though it is the same bag."}
{"prompt": "P√•se v Kasse", "completion": "Well that‚Äôs just great. Now I won‚Äôt be able to go to sleep!"}
{"prompt": "P√•se v Kasse", "completion": "For me a p√•se is kind of soft in material and shape, no matter if it is big with handles or small with drawstrings or a frysp√•se you tie with a knot or put a clip on. When big enugh a p√•se becomes a s√§ck.   \nA kasse is structured, usually with a defined square bottom and it always has handles."}
{"prompt": "P√•se v Kasse", "completion": "**Svenska Akademien:   p√•sen inga handtag, kassen har handtag**.\n\nSo no handles a p√•se and with handles a kasse.  If you can add a cat to your p√•se then it is a s√§ck."}
{"prompt": "P√•se v Kasse", "completion": "I'm Swedish and I'm sorry to confuse you even more, but I use p√•se most times. (Southern Sweden)\n\nGenerally I would say kasse is bigger and less fancy. Something you use for grocery shopping. P√•se can be fancier and boutique style."}
{"prompt": "P√•se v Kasse", "completion": "Without looking anything up, my own definition is something like this:\n\nP√•se - small-medium sized (almost always plastic, up to and including shopping bag sized)\n\nKasse - medium sized (shopping bag sized+-, fabric or paper)\n\nS√§ck - large sized (plastic or fabric)\n\nA 1-10 L plastic bag is always a p√•se. A shopping bag might be called both p√•se and kasse. A fabric bag would be considered a kasse but might still be called p√•se sometimes. A paper bag with handles would not be called p√•se ever. S√§ck would be large think 50-100L plastic bag or fabric something like Santa's sack (cognate).\n\nI hope that makes sense, anyone else feel free to correct my breakdown."}
{"prompt": "P√•se v Kasse", "completion": "I usually use ‚Äúkasse‚Äù when referring to a plastic or paper bag like what you would buy at the grocer. When I use ‚ÄúP√•se‚Äù I‚Äôm referring to other bags like cloth bags or just generally any other bags that aren‚Äôt a ‚Äúkasse‚Äù."}

They have been around since the 1940s and offer courses and activities in many places around the country.\n\nNote that it is not a university or centre of higher education.

{"prompt": "My plan for learning Svenska", "completion": ">Any added thoughts, ideas perspectives?\n\nI've been teaching Swedish for more than 20 years so this is just my perspective as a teacher. People might not agree with me but that's okay. \n\n  \n1. Duolingo is good as an entry to the language. Don't rely too much on it and know when to turn your back and get something else. Babble is a good alternative.\n\n2. Textbooks are great tools to keep you within a framework of learning. I can recommend Form i fokus, Se upp!, and Text i fokus.\n\n3. Starting with Swedish news for complexity when you're a beginner is like a kid in high school learning maths by studying quantum physics. It'll only get you really frustrated. Saying that, I suggest watching \"Nyheter p√• l√§tt svenska\" and similar programs. The podcast \"Livet p√• l√§tt svenska\" is also great.\n\n4. This is a fantastic idea.

A lot of people see the militarism and imperialism of the US negatively, so they may not respond well or positively to this, and also think the whole thing is a bit cringe.

I wish Mango was a bit more engaging for my kids (not gamified at all the way Duolingo is) b/c I have wondered if it is doing more damage than good when it comes to pronunciation. \n\nA funny story though is that my oldest (under 10 yo) said to me after starting Duolingo in Swedish, \"Well, Mommy, I'm sorry to tell you this, but now I know how to order a beer.\" Hahahaha"}

Not natural at all.\n\nDen h√§r can be used in both speech and written language, although denna feels a bit more formal while den h√§r feels a bit more casual.\n\nSo, when talking: always use den h√§r, when writing: both work, but denna is a bit more formal than den h√§r.\n\nBy the way, denna is used with indefinite (ex. denna bok) and den h√§r is used with definite (ex. den h√§r boken)."}

{"prompt": "masculine / feminine / neuter", "completion": "Old norse had three forms of \"a\": einn, ein and eitt for M, F and N respectively. The diphthongs were monophthonised in almost all Swedish dialects, and in most dislects (excluding the dialects whence the standard language came), the short n disappeared, and the long n was shortened. This gives you en, e and ett, which is what you find in many dialects, e.g. in Kejsarn av Portugallien by Selma Lagerl√∂f.\n\nThe same thing happened with the definite suffixes which were -enn, -en and -et, and which underwent the same change, plus that the vowel of -e shifted to -a. This gives the definite suffixes found in most Swedish dialects.\n\nIn the areas around Stockholm and Uppsala (and also in southern Sweden), this didn't happen. Instead enn and en merged as en. This is what the standard language comes from.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/dialekter/comments/1gep4bq/best%C3%A4md_%C3%A4ndelse_p%C3%A5_starka_femininer_i_svenska/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\n\nHere is a map of feminine endings in Swedish dialects.\n\nSimilar things happeded to the neuter definite plural endings, where -en (such as in barnen) were changed to -a (barna). This to a certain extent is still prevalent, with many many variations. I myself barely use -en for neuter definite plurals, instead mosly using -ena, or -a for a few words.\n\nTake a look in r/dialekter, and you'll find that there is a LOT of variations, also in e.g. masculine plural definites which can be everything from -a to -era to -ana and more."}

{"prompt": "How do I avoid apps?", "completion": "u/WoodpeckerCold5558\n\nMy thoughts:\n\n1. The daily grind is actually your best friend. Everybody likes to think that language learning is a matter of finesse and great intelligence. But the reality is that more than 50% of the work is just memorising words. If you don't have the words assimilated and internalised, in all of their forms, you have nothing to be fluent about, it's tragically simple.\n\nESPECIALLY for a Scandinavian language (i.e. simple grammar/level of inflexion compared to any European language other than English, and indeed a lot of overlaps with English which is very handy if you have learned English as a second language), I feel there is relatively little to \"figure out\", so memorisation plays an even bigger role maybe.\n\n2) Information \"not sticking anymore\" sounds to me like you have likely learned to \"game\" Duolingo, which lends itself to being gamed a lot anyway. But in general, if things don't stick, you likely need more grind, not less, sorry to say.\n\n3) A tutor will help you ensure your \"output\" is correct: you can write and speak in their presence and they'll correct you straight away. Talking to them will force you to produce the language on the spot, which is what you'll need IRL. They are the best \"tool\" to practice what you have learned with live feedback, a bit like a sports game at the weekend is. But training and preparation need to happen beforehand, likely on your own, because a tutor won't do much to put you on a steady diet of learning the notions. It's 2025 and software is much better suited for this task, like it or not. [Give this a go](https://mjolnirapp.com/swedish/) but yes, it has the daily expectation.\n\n4) Everybody was better suited to learn languages in their teenage years. Different brain plasticity, less busy life. I still remember an astounding amount of the French I have studied age 11 to 13, which I'd happily trade for my WIP Swedish. But it doesn't work like that : ("}
{"prompt": "How do I avoid apps?", "completion": "I live in Sweden but have worked in English most of the time I've lived here, so I can't get a full immersion experience. What has helped me is listening to Swedish music when I'm working etc. Also, I listen to Swedish audiobooks. When I started, I started when books I'd read in English and already knew the plot really, really well. (I started with the whole Harry Potter series because I'm a millennial and knew them like the back of my hand. ) I continued into YA books I read as a teen/ young adult. Now, I'm able to listen to adult level books that I haven't read before and can understand. I actually just was speaking to a Swedish friend yesterday in Swedish that I hadn't spoken to in a year, and he was shocked at my progress. Watching Swedish movies and TV is also helpful. I have kids so never have time to watch TV.  üòÖ As far as speaking, do you know anyone in real life that can speak Swedish with you? You need someone who will just only speak Swedish and won't switch to English (or whatever language is your most comfortable). That can be the hardest part if you're not in Sweden."}
{"prompt": "How do I avoid apps?", "completion": "What's your current level?\nI did take a course that my uni was offering and passed it recently (woho), but to be honest, while it was an important piece of the puzzle, it was just that: a piece. Meeting once per week and doing homework wasn't all that I needed. Progress came from combining it with, yes, apps.\n\nAs much as the apps I'm using aren't perfect, and all of them have their shortcomings, they‚Äôre the ones that motivate me to do something daily. I agree with another poster on this: don't give up on daily grinding easily.\n\nI'm using Babbel (though you're right, especially for shorter words, it's sometimes impossible to satisfy it with pronunciation) and two AI speaking apps. They keep me going, even if I‚Äôm, I don't know, sitting sick at home. I also recently borrowed a book on Swedish grammar. If I'm tired of one thing, then hopefully, I can still find some appeal in another.\n\nAs for websites and podcasts, the ones that seem most interesting to me are Simple Swedish Podcast and Livet p√• l√§tt svenska. That‚Äôs just my personal choice. For tutors online, several of my colleagues found people via Preply, but I haven't tried it yet. The discussion reminded me that Folkuniversitetet offers online Swedish courses, which I are also available to learners abroad. To be honest, though, I‚Äôve heard very mixed opinions. Some of my colleagues were quite unhappy with their online courses and considered them a waste of time and money. As far as I know, teachers at Folkuniversitetet aren‚Äôt required to have any formal pedagogical training."}

But I can stumble a bit with a word I might need practice on in a sentence and they count the whole thing right, and don't make me practice it anymore. \n\nI did look into in person classes. Good god was that a hard no. There is a college in southern Ohio that offers it, but it's all in person and that college is 2 hours away from me. Oh and there's the American Swedish Institute in Minnesota! That is to say, it appears I'm in a language desert of sorts when it comes to Swedish. \n\nI think moving forward, I'll go back to several duo lessons a day if I can (had to drop to just 1 a day with my schedule). I also think writing down everything they teach me is good. I also want to look into getting books in Swedish. If I can personally read it I think it'll help with my learning style."}

{"prompt": "Old spelling or specific reason?", "completion": "When you‚Äôre reading older Swedish texts, anything from 1950 onwards has contemporary spelling, pretty much. \n\nLate nineteenth and early twentieth century works were in a state of flux, where the old verb forms  (‚Äúvi voro‚Äù instead of ‚Äúvi var‚Äù) and the hv/w/f spellings for v slowly went out of fashion. Sentence structure also simplified slowly in this era. It‚Äôs still pretty readable. \n\nEighteenth and early nineteenth century works were a lot less regulated regarding spelling. You can sometimes see the old noun declensions. Once you get used to the variants, it‚Äôs still mostly understandable. \n\nSixteenth and seventeenth century works require a lot more work. Grammar and vocabulary has changed significantly, and spelling was a free for all. I like to quote a passage from the Church Law of 1686, that banned drums from wedding music (and thus also from most of Swedish folk music). ‚ÄúIngen Brudeskara m√• komma til Kyrckian, med Trummor, skiutande, och hwariehanda otienligit Buller; Skeer thet, t√• skola s√•dane plichta efter Stadgan.‚Äù ‚ÄúIngen brudeskara m√• (f√•r) komma till kyrkan med trummor, skjutande och varjehanda otj√§nligt buller.

{"prompt": "Old spelling or specific reason?", "completion": "In the grand scheme it's certainly insignificant, but in some regards Swedish spelling today is more \"archaic\" than that of 50 years ago. \n\nThe '70s started the big push for more phonemic spelling (e.g., *juice ‚Äì> jos*, *mig ‚Äì> mej*, *de/dem ‚Äì> dom*), but it ultimately failed to achieve broad approval and mostly fizzled out in the '90s.

And lingq has been great once I had a grasp of the language to learn more. \n\nThere is no one method, and people need different things. Along with those, I listened to a lot of Swedish music, watched swedish tv shows, and practiced with my Swedish family. Having a good base in Swedish has allowed me to get a lot more from sfi.\n\n\nGood luck!"}
{"prompt": "How did you learn Swedish?", "completion": "Lived 4 years in üá∏üá™ The first year I went to the library and translated easy books (in the 90s, used a physical dictionary :) as well as watching subtitled American tv shows.  My friends and family also only spoke Swedish with me. I had headaches for a couple months, and my comprehension outpaced my speaking initially.  It was about a year before I felt confident and comfortable with my speaking abilities."}
{"prompt": "How did you learn Swedish?", "completion": "Learning Swedish was a pivotal time in my life where I learned about ‚Äúspaced repetition,‚Äù which is a term I had never heard before. I mixed that with mnemonics and imagined visuals.¬†\n\nExamples: Ett vs En.\n\nIf a noun is ‚Äúett‚Äù, I mentally create a visual for myself of the object being outside. Where was the apple, when I pictured it in my mind? It was outside, smack dab in the middle of Kungstr√§dg√•rden. Giant. Huge. Comically big. The more ridiculous the size in my mind, the more likely I am to remember it. Comedy helps memory.\n\nIf a word is ‚Äúen,‚Äù I visualize it being inside. En sang. Where is the bed? It‚Äôs inside the kitchen! Why is it in the kitchen?? Why put it there? We do not ask such questions! There is simply a big ol bed hogging up space in the kitchen (in my mind). It‚Äôs funny, and easy to remember because of how odd it is.\n\nSo now when I want to remember whether apple and bed are ett eller en, all I have to do is think about where I visualized the ridiculous apple and the ridiculous bed. Outside? Ett. Inside? En.\n\nThe spaced repetition, for me, looked like this.¬†\n1) Learn a word.\n2) Review it 10 min later\n3) Review it 1 day later.\n4) Review it 3 days later.\n5) Review it 7 days later.\n6) Review it 2 weeks later.\n7) Review it 1 month later.\n\nIf at any point in time, I can‚Äôt remember the Swedish word without cheating and looking at the answer, I start from step 1 again.\n\nSee the pattern? The amount of time kind of keeps increasing. 2 months, 4 months, 6 months. Soon you only need to review that vocab once a year to remember it in your long term memory.\n\nAlthough, ideally, you would see it while reading simple Swedish texts from time to time.\n\nI started with physical flash cards and then moved everything into Anki.\n\nWhen to stop Anki? It‚Äôs up to you. When you feel like you don‚Äôt really need it anymore because you‚Äôre already getting enough exposure to Swedish.\n\nAll of this was taught to me by a guy whose job was to teach students how to use spaced repetition. It helped immensely to have him teach me in person, because admittedly it can be a little confusing when hearing all of this for the first time.\n\nIn the meantime, I attended SFI classes for 6 months and practiced Swedish with my immigrant friends and some locals in town of all ages. I read children‚Äôs books bring the library in Stockholm. I even had a temporary job for a few months at Gr√∂na Lund, serving hot dogs, hamburgers and ice cream, using English and Swedish.\n\nBack home in America, I still have two thriller books from Sweden, that I occasionally read for fun."}

I added words I didn't know to an Anki deck (but only important ones for the beginning, such as \"att ha\" and not like \"o√•tkomlig\", which comes in handy later but not as core vocabulary imo). I reviewed those cards everyday. Now I'm on book 3 of The Witcher in Swedish.\n\nBy no means I'm saying that I've \"learned\" Swedish, I'm still honestly not great at it and I still have an insane amount of things to learn but I don't need my sambo or switch to English when I go outside and meet people.

{"prompt": "Generic word for aunt or uncle", "completion": "It's very old fashioned but there used to be two loanwords for that ‚Äì 'onkel' and 'tant'. Both from French.

For some time before du-reformen, when titles still were used, 'tant' and 'farbror' were the titles for addressing adult strangers by younger people. 'Farbror' retained it's meaning of paternal uncle, though, and would be understood as only that once titles were dropped. The word 'tant', however, underwent a semantic shift and became 'old lady' as mentioned. I wouldn't recommend using either of them.

{"prompt": "Alternative symbols for √§/√∂/√•?", "completion": "Unlike in German, √•, √§ and √∂ are considered their own letters in Swedish. You really shouldn't treat them as versions of a and o. Most physical keyboards should have a dead key for two dots above a vowel, but √• can still be tricky to write. \n\nA decent substitute if it's hard to write the letters is aa for √•, ae for √§, and oe for √∂. This is how the letters are often written in things like sports events that only support the basic 26 letters of the English alphabet."}

{"prompt": "Alternative symbols for √§/√∂/√•?", "completion": "As you say, √• √§ √∂ are completely separate letters from a and o and we perceive them as such. When we have to, like if we're using a foreign keyboard or typing somewhere that only allows english letters, then we most often just use a or o instead and hope that the context will make it clear what we're trying to actually type.\n\nThe a'e'i'o'u is a creative solution, but there aren't really readily available characters for the dots above √• √§ √∂ to do something similar with."}
{"prompt": "Alternative symbols for √§/√∂/√•?", "completion": "√∂ and √§ could feasibly be written as oe and ae respectively. I don't actually know what you'd write for √•. But to kinda dodge the question, even if some keyboards don't have √•√§√∂, most I've seen still have ¬® as a character which you could just slap onto an a or o. Then once again √• is the odd one out.

View speaking as playing any instrument, you will only get good at it if you spend countless hours embracing the suck. I do mnemonics to associate if possible for new words, just in passing and when I feel like it. All words don't have easy paths to associate with, we are all limited by our imagination and languages we already know well, so sometimes things just have to be repeated 100 times to stick. \n\nI'm also looking for places to go where I can find native speakers but it's prooving difficult. as I don't live in the country it's tough so I go online and find friends through games but I know for sure there's native speakers about I just need to ask for it and the old Fellow up there might give you what you ask for.

{"prompt": "Advice about Learning Svenska", "completion": "Use your ears more than your eyes.

That is why \"sedan\" can also be written \"sen\".\n\nAs has already been pointed out, this has the unfortunate effect that there exists a possible source of confusion when reading Swedish aloud, because there is another word spelled \"sen\", pronounced with a long vowel (/se:n/), meaning \"late\"."}

{"prompt": "When do you use \"m√§rka av\" instead of m√§rka?", "completion": "As you might know, these are called phrasal verbs (\"partikelverb\"). Oftentimes, they convey an absolutely necessary distinction - telling someone to \"g√• och h√§ng dig\" is certainly very different from telling them to \"g√• och h√§ng *av* dig\". But in some cases, the particles are more optional - the difference is less clear between \"√∂ppna upp en butik\" and \"√∂ppna en butik\" or \"frysa ned en fisk\" and \"frysa en fisk\". \n\nI would say that \"m√§rka av\" falls in the second category in most situations.\nTwo examples from Google, conveying the same meaning:\n\n*Postnord bygger egen AI: ‚ÄùKunderna kommer m√§rka det‚Äù*\n\n*Officeren: Halmstadborna kommer m√§rka av samarbetet med USA*\n\nIf I really think about it, I might say that \"m√§rka av\" has a more passive sense to it. It's rather something you \"sense\", \"perceive\" or \"feel\" than actively \"notice\". It sounds wrong to say \"Jag l√§ste boken noga och m√§rkte *av m√•nga stavfel\" - here I would absolutely just say \"m√§rkte\". On the other hand the \"av\" feels more natural in \"Janne m√§rkte av jordskalvet trots att det skedde flera mil bort\".\n\nIt should be mentioned that we also sometimes have a tendency to put a particle where it is not needed at all. You may hear e.g. \"minska ned p√• farten\" or \"backa tillbaka bandet\"."}

The right way to go about this is to recognize the larger pattern, that \"k√§nna av\" is a phrasal verb that is distinct from the normal verb \"k√§nna\", just like how \"feel up\" is a phrasal verb distinct from the normal verb \"feel\".\n\nPhrasal verb are *usually* but not always related to the root verb, they're usually some kind of variation of it, or shares the same movement, or they're just a metaphorical version of it. Just compare English phrasal verbs based on turn: turn on, turn off, turn up, turn down, turn into, turn around, turn out, turn in, turn over, turn back, and turn against. These are distinct verbs that you have to learn the meaning of, and Swedish works exactly the same.\n\nWhen you learn a verb in Swedish, you can also look up and learn the phrasal verbs based on it, so if you're learning \"k√§nna\", you should also learn:\n\n* \"k√§nna av\" - Be aware of a feeling, test how something feels\n* \"k√§nna till\" - Know of something or someone, Be acuainted with\n* \"k√§nna vid\" - Be associated with\n* \"k√§nna f√∂r\" - Have feelings for\n* \"k√§nna in\" - Explore a feeling"}

For double r, I would personally be more inclined to use some sort of alveolar fricative or approximant. It's perhaps a bit like the English approximant r, except not retroflex, with the tip of the tongue placed further forward, without lip rounding, and with some friction; so not *that* similar to the English r. It is also still very much distinct from the English z and  í (as in \"trea**s**ure\").

{"prompt": "dela med sig", "completion": "IIRC it comes from a \"dela\" that refers to divvying something up for others to enjoy. The \"med sig\" in the meaning *with oneself*, to mark that you also are also included in the pool.

It seems to be primarily a way to evoke the feeling of old times, nature (big in Swedish lore), loss and mystic vibes, to bring the music forward. \n\nQuick translation\n\nNow the mist is dancing on the lake, which the sun awoke\n\nThen the (morning) dew glimmer in the [heather](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ericaceae) that the night gave in a silver tear (the tear being the dew?)\n\nA [sea bird](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loon) complaints about death, be greeted friend\n\nEach time she wakes up in the soil, and is reborn\n\n\nSee, she glides forward with the haze in the mist (or the female mythical creatures. In contemporary Swedish, dis is haze, used together with dimma (dis och dimma) but you're right that there is an archaic and mythical use, especially written diserna. May be a play on words)\n\nSo shimmering and cold (the she, which could still be the bird)\n\n\nThat day brings its sacrifice, to light creatures\n\nIf her shoulders so white, a mantle for the hanged's god\n\nSee flowers bloom at the grave, they speak of the years\n\nIt's happiness lost, in somber dress\n\n\nLovely was the dance, spirited and wild\n\nThe logs aflame, sun is setting\n\nThe looks sparkling with eyes so blue\n\nStill they wander in a ring of purest gold\n\n\n\nShe is [waking](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_(ceremony)) with her song\nDisappearing in the mist\n\nJust from the lyrics, I'm not sure but I would guess it's a song about someone lost years ago, and he's reminded of the grief by the song of the sea bird, the flowers at the grave. And while their live together (the dance) was spirited and wild, with their looks sparkling with their blue eyes, her memory is fading into the mist and he's trying to keep hold of the memory.\n\nThere is the one mention of reborn, not sure if that fits with the rest. Maybe some allusion to nature being reborn or his memory of her reborn in the morning. It might just be a throw in reference because it worked with the music. Same with the reference to the god(dess) of criminals (Hel), it might just have been that she was white as a corpse, so the shoulders are white as the mantle of a corpse.\n\nIt can also be that all these references are very common and meaningful in a particular subculture, where it all makes sense. But there are so many dangling modifiers, change in tense and other unusual things in the lyric that it could also just be that they're pretty words that match the music and convey certain sentiments about nature, loss, a longing for a purer time.\n\nHope it helps!"}

{"prompt": "I translated my favourite song, but still have no idea what it's about - maybe I'm missing context?", "completion": "Thank you a lot! Yeah, I think this really helps honestly. And I think you're right that it's probably more about the entire atmoshpere and picture than very specific meaning in every line. \n\nI would agree with your interpretation and think it's a lot more fleshed out. So thank you for that, I can get in my own head obsessing over minute things sometimes, this is a very good image to have of the song.\n\nAbout the rebirth line, I think it makes a lot of sense that she is reborn in his memory. That the nature around him reminds him of her so much she awakes with the sun every morning and dies again when it goes down. That part of her lives on in him and all that reminds him of her. Maybe it's just a really nice way of saying \"I still think about you every day\".\n\nI am aware that the song has some archaic words and there's some poetic liberty. While translating it I thought to myself that I probably chose a bad song to learn from given my level of Swedish is not very high. But I enjoyed it a lot, and I'm not all that worried about picking up bad habits given that like 90% of my Swedish learning is done listening to Swedish meant for native speakers (that is not poetry). Like I can see that √§ro is an old version for are, but it's not going to confuse me in standard Swedish. I do want to get my Swedish to a very high level, so I don't really see the issue learning some more obscure words in the \"wrong order\", and having such a strong liking for the song is going to make me remember words like daggen a lot better than just learning it by heart down the line.\n\nThere's also probably a reason I like Swedish Folk Metal that much, I'm just a fun of how the words are used to create an atmoshpere, the nature themes, the poetic liberty and archaic feeling. I like those things about the songs.\n\nAlso thank you for the full translation, and the pointers about some specific things."}

In English, \"Station\" has completely lost the T sound. In Swedish, \"Station\" has lost it almost all of the time, but it remains in some dialects. In Italian, \"Stazione\" has a clearly pronounced T (at least to a swedish speaker), even though it's not spelled with one."}
{"prompt": "Why is the \"t\" pronounced in \"nation\" but not \"emigration\"?", "completion": "Interesting question! I can't find anything specifically about the pronunciation of the suffix *-tion* in Swedish, but generally speaking such pronunciation differences have to do with 1) the age of the borrowing and 2) via which languages it came into the language.\n\nFor example the words *kalas* and *kollation* refer to slightly different kinds of party. They both come from Latin *collatio*, but the former evolved within Low German before it was borrowed into Swedish.\n\nAnother example is the word *l√§xa* meaning 'homework' which is a very old borrowing and therefore underwent some changes in Swedish but is ultimately from Latin *lectio* 'reading'. The word *lektion* comes from the same source but is pronounced with /…ß/ as you would expect because it was borrowed more recently.\n\nIn Modern French *nation* is pronounced with an / É/ but in Old French it would have been pronounced with /tsj/. I'm speculating a bit here, but it could be that the Swedish words with /t…ß/ like *nation* are older borrowings than the ones pronounced without a /t/ or were at least influenced by such older borrowings.\n\n(Edit: / É/ is the normal English sh-sound. /…ß/ is that weird Swedish 'sj-ljud'.)"}

{"prompt": "I don‚Äôt know whether to laugh or cry", "completion": "> How do you figure out the gender to something that typically has none.\n\nYou **don't** figure it out, you look it up.\n\nThis goes for learning every single language that has gendered nouns. You look it up, and you learn the gender of the noun as part of learning the noun itself.\n\nYou don't learn that house is \"hus\" and car is \"bil\". You learn that a house is \"ett hus\" and a car is \"en bil\".\n\nIn German, you don't learn that cat is \"Katze\" and dog is \"Hund\". You learn that the cat is \"die Katze\", and you learn that the dog is \"der Hund\".\n\nLater, as you become more proficient, you'll develop a feel for what gender a noun you haven't seen before has. There are rules, but don't bother looking them up or learning the rules. There are a lot of exceptions, so the whole thing is essentially based on vibes.\n\nTo actually figure out what the gender *ought to be* of a new word, you have to be native or near-native, and even then it can feel ambiguous and lead to native speakers disagreeing."}

It‚Äôs a great resource.\n\nAs for En and Ett, there are no perfect rules. You‚Äôll basically just have to memorize which one is used with what noun, and this comes with practice.\n\nIt can help to know that roughly 75% of Swedish nouns use en, and about 25% use ett.\n\nOnce you arrive and get your personnummer (personal number), you should enroll in SFI (Swedish for Immigrants) or if you can...  hire a private tutor to help you get started properly.\n\nTo get better, you must speak Swedish every day.\n\nThere are no shortcuts.\n\nDon‚Äôt fall into the trap of thinking that because you‚Äôre a native English speaker and Swedes are excellent at speaking English, you can just get by.\n\nWhile it‚Äôs true that you can communicate in English, relying on it won‚Äôt help you learn the language, and in the long run, it will only hinder your progress.\n\nLycka till."}
{"prompt": "I don‚Äôt know whether to laugh or cry", "completion": "\nIn Swedish, the noun is either n-genus (common gender) or t-genus (neuter). As a native Swede, you learn this when you grow up. It is more difficult for those who want to learn Swedish as a foreign language.\n\nIn general, living beings are n-words. But there are exceptions, e.g. child (barn) and lion (lejon) that are t-words. In short, there are no fixed rules for this.\n\nIn Swedish, you use the articles 'en' or 'ett' before nouns. They are both the same word as the numeral 'one'. Since you can't clearly tell from the noun when to use 'en' or 'ett' for it, you simply have to learn and remember which one it is.\n\n'En' (common gender) is more common than 'ett' (neuter).\n\n[74% of all nouns are en nouns and 26% are ett nouns.  Thus, if you are not sure you can always go with en and more often than not you‚Äôll be correct!\nBy looking at the first letter of the noun alone, you cannot determine if it is an en or ett noun.\nThe last letter of a noun is a strong determinant of en or ett.  Most clearly, if a noun ends in ‚Äúa‚Äù it is an en noun 98% of the time. For words ending in ‚Äúm‚Äù or ‚Äúp‚Äù, they are more likely than most nouns to be an ett noun, but still more likely to be an en noun.](https://www.swedishfreak.com/swedish-language/learn-for-free/en-and-ett-in-swedish/)"}
{"prompt": "I don‚Äôt know whether to laugh or cry", "completion": "I'm going to be brutally honest: I would focus on learning the vocabulary and the grammar, and just let the *en*/*ett* stuff come naturally (and if you don't know, err on the side of *en*). Don't get me wrong -- you should learn *en* or *ett* with the word. But don't agonize if you find yourself forgetting.\n\nThere's seldom rhyme or reason and it's one of those things you gradually absorb with exposure. It's quite unlikely you'll be misunderstood; native speakers are really good at context. I mean, people mess up there/their/they're or lose/loose in English all the time and we can still make perfect sense of it.\n\nIn other words, don't get so hung up on it that it discourages you from learning the language.\n\nMy mom's family is from Sweden but I never spoke it growing up (but was exposed to it). Once I started picking it up in earnest, I learned way faster talking with her than with language learning material. I probably still make dumb mistakes. But unless you're going to Sweden to write dissertations in Swedish, the ultimate goal is to understand and be understood. Perfection will come with exposure.\n\nLycka till med pluggandet!"}

There are more en-words than ett-words, if that's any help.\n\nWether you use min or mitt, din or ditt, sin or sitt, v√•r or v√•rt, er or ert, adjectives in their basic form or with an added t in front of a noun also depends on the gender of the noun (utrum or neutrum)."}

But, this is mostly limited to a couple of their accent patterns that happen to be at least somewhat comparable to accents 1 and 2 in Swedish. For anything outside of those patterns I'm probably about as lost as an English speaker would be.

{"prompt": "Any native speakers of Asian tonal languages here? Did you recognise Swedish as having tonal features without it being pointed out to you?", "completion": "Just sing it like a childrens song and youre right. I find that Swedish has only the very basic of tonality as in a question or a statent. Word with exact same spelling and prononciation are understood by context.¬†\nAltho I dont speak a tonal language I speak a languahe where tone is far more important and tells more than Swedish.¬†\ni.e same words can imply yes or no.\nIn swedish they say something like ‚Äùnja‚Äù but the tone variation is minimal so its almost impossible to understand the meaning from tone a lone. (this would be the more emotional tones that arent technically ‚Äùtonal‚Äù .)¬†\n\n\nIn general for ppl trying to sound native I would suggest focusing on where in your mouth you speak.\nIm going to use english/american as an example for practical reasons.\nIf you think about a generic american accent or something close to the californian accent (not valley girl but a little ¬†lol) Then the sentences are ‚Äùmuddy‚Äù and the words ‚Äùround‚Äù. The emphasis is on the end of the sentence tonally.\nBasically mumbling and letting the words sort of sit in your mouth/back of throat.\n\nIf that is how you prefer to speak english then the ‚ÄùG√∂teborska‚Äù dialekt is for you!\n\nIf you tend to speak with your lips and front of mouth more like brittish english then ‚ÄùStockholmska‚Äù is your go to.\n\nIve maybe been in G√∂teborg for an hour tops but Ive had ppl mention I have a slight g√∂teborska accent lol¬†\n\n\nAnother big thing I notice is that Swedish is very limiting in a way that as you start a sentence thats the way it has to end .\nWith that I mean that in other languages when speaking you can start a sentence and change it a long the way.\nWith swedish you have to stop and start over 3 words in because its just not a flexible language its quite direct.\n\nMany ppl learning to speak get flustered about this but natives do it all the time reflexively.\n\nIdk if I explained this well at all in text but these are the tips Ive given to many many ppl learning Swedish and the change/effects where instantaneous which can really boost your confidence!¬†"}

{"prompt": "Tips on learning Swedish?", "completion": "I'm only a couple weeks ahead of you. After I unlock new words, I go to the vocab list (under the practice section) and make flash cards for them.

{"prompt": "Tips on learning Swedish?", "completion": "If you‚Äôre in Sweden, I really recommend signing up for SFI (Swedish for Immigrants). Duolingo is a nice place to start, especially for getting used to the basics, but when it comes to grammar and everyday conversation, SFI is much more helpful. You get to speak with others and learn in context, which makes a big difference.\n\nIf you're not in Sweden, Babbel is a better option than Duolingo. It‚Äôs more structured and gives you a proper foundation, instead of just teaching random words without showing how to actually use them in a sentence.\n\nIt also helps a lot to watch Swedish TV shows or listen to music and podcasts.

{"prompt": "Grammatical gender rules in modern Swedish", "completion": "I would take a look at Norwegian, since you still have active use of three genders there in the written standards.

{"prompt": "Grammatical gender rules in modern Swedish", "completion": "Many people are saying that this isn't a thing in Swedish anymore, but in many of the Swedish dialects that are spoken in Finland it very much is, and I think to some degree in dialects spoken in Sweden as well.\n\nI can't easily tell you what the rules are though as we change the words up so much when we speak that the rules aren't, to me at least, that easy to transfer to \"norm Swedish\".\n\nHere are some examples anyway.\n\nIf a word ends with -in, it's masculine: hande stolin, hande handduutchin (that chair, that towel, masc version. Norm Swedish: den d√§r stolen, den d√§r handduken)\n\nIf a word ends in -on, or -en, it's feminine: honde bj√§rtchen, honde roson (that birch tree and that rose, feminine version.

{"prompt": "Grammatical gender rules in modern Swedish", "completion": "Swedish doesn‚Äôt use masculine and feminine gender. The genders in Swedish are *neuter* and *common*. \n\nAs an example, both pojke and flicka uses common gender, so it‚Äôs *en pojke* and *en flicka*. The same item can be referred to as both neuter and common depending on the synonym chosen. So it‚Äôs *ett hus* but *en byggnad* even if you are talking about the same house or building. \n\nThere is no rule that governs gender in Swedish. You need to learn it word for word. \n\nSmall side note: a small number of words can be gendered in the male/female sense. For example, if you ask someone *Vad √§r klockan?*, you could hear *Hon √§r kvart i tre*, giving the word *klocka* a female gender. It‚Äôs not very common though and it would often be considered more appropriate to use *den/det*. So you might encounter male/female gendering when reading and hearing Swedish, but going with neuter and common is better when you are learning the language."}

I can usually do the phrases because it gives you a little leniency, but there are certain words that individually it just will not accept for me no matter what or how I say it.\n\nAlso, if you're using the free version, the ads are absolutely out of control.

So \"vederlag\" is \"the order of return\" (salary, compensation etc). Tangentially there's also \"vederg√§llning\", so something like \"the act of return\" (revenge).\n\nOther examples that one can investigate and speculate around include \"underlag\" and why not the good old \"samlag\". I would also strongly suspect that the other meaning of the word \"lag\" apart from law, that is the meaning of \"team\", is strongly related to \"being in order\". In some Swedish dialects, if two people have some kind of friendly relationship then they are \"i lag\"."}

{"prompt": "Is Swedish harder than Norwegian for me?", "completion": "You'd have to decide on which version of Norwegian you'd be interested in, Nynorsk or Bokm√•l, and there's quite a big difference between them (relatively speaking). That's where the big regional differences come into play. The areas in the south, around Oslo, and the north are Bokm√•l and the areas in the west (area around Bergen) are Nynorsk, and then there's also a bunch of communities that haven't chosen one or the other so it can be a patchwork of Nynorsk vs. Bokm√•l. Thing is, **no one actually speaks Nynorsk or Bokm√•l**, they are two variants of *written* Norwegian. Bokm√•l is generally very close to the Oslo dialect, though.\n\nWhile there is mutual intelligibility, there's no one standard language you can use in all of Norway (like Algemeen Nederlands that you can use in all of the Netherlands and Flanders). My guess is that you'll probably (have to) learn Bokm√•l, as it's the most used.\n\nSwedish, on the other hand, does have a sort of standard version that you can use in all of the country: rikssvenska. There are significant differences between Swedish dialects too, but not as big as between Norwegian dialects. Rikssvenska isn't an official thing, though, it's just the form of the Swedish language that is used by, say, the news. It's also the form of Swedish you learn as a foreigner. It's based on the central Swedish version of the language, which is from the area of Stockholm.\n\nOther than that, there really isn't **that** big a difference between Norwegian and Swedish, they're both relatively easy for a Dutch-speaker to learn."}

(Eller svengelska) Focus on being able to talk about family relationships. \"Min papa hette Karl, hans syster Lisa flyttade till USA in the seventies, she was social worker...\" Just use english words in your swedish. Use words like farfar and moster in your english because they're more specific than the english words anyway. This will put your family at ease when speaking either English or Swedish in your presence, and don't hesitate to answer in English when you understand the question in Swedish. Also, learn the words for your job/profession. You'll be asked over and over about how you're related, and what you do, so practice explaining that in Swedish.

{"prompt": "Var + g√•", "completion": "Yes if i am not wrong you could say vart ska n√•t g√• but that means it will change still from what it is. Var g√• means how  is it now.

In other words, before you can say a word or recognise it in speech, you have to simply know it. I've been using Mjolnir Swedish for a bit and I'm very happy with it. It's very \"lean\", and it really aims at giving you loads of relevant knowledge for your level.   \nI've learned foreign languages to fluency before so I feel the \"hand-holding\" of classes is just not for me.

{"prompt": "What words are specific to J√∂nk√∂ping?", "completion": "Hey! I'm from J√∂nk√∂ping.\n\nTbh, I've heard a lot about specific J√∂nk√∂ping slang (for example \"tjavon\"), but nowadays they aren't really used. Maybe older people still do, but as a teenager I don't really hear them nor do I use them.\n\nIt should be noted that the J√∂nk√∂ping dialect differs a lot from the traditional sm√•l√§ndska dialect. I'd even say that my speech is probably closer to someone from G√∂teborg (although still with noticeable differences) than it is to someone from southern Sm√•land. Which is also proved by J√∂nk√∂ping dialect being classified as a G√∂tam√•l rather than a Sydsvenskam√•l which is the case for much of Sm√•land.\n\nBut one word that I think of right now is \"j√§mte\" = \"bredvid\". Afaik it is seen as archaic by most of Sweden, but here it is the standard word. Although I think that it's more of a southern Sweden (G√∂taland) word (except for Sk√•ne) than it is a J√∂nk√∂ping word.\n\nAnother thing is that we (I at least) use a lot of √Ñ where \"standard Swedish\" wouldn't. For example: Med -> M√§, Bebis -> B√§bis, Beige -> B√§sh, Det -> D√§, √Ñr = √Ñ.\n\nSo I would say \"Vad √§r det med den beiga bebisen?\" as \"Va √§ d√§ m√§ den b√§sha b√§bisen?\" while someone from Stockholm probably would say it as \"Va e de me den besha bebisen?\".\n\nI can't think of more right now, I'll edit the post if something more pops up.\n\nBest of luck!"}

I have one friend who says \"katig\", I don't though. I really wouldn't say there are a lot of unique words that we use.\n\nI even recorded myself speaking not that long ago, and most people guessed that I was from V√§stra G√∂taland... The reason as to why, was that Sm√•land melody + pronounces R + Not really any dialectal words = V√§stkusten, apparently. \n\nOther J√∂nk√∂pingsbor that popped into the conversation also said that they have also often been mistaken for G√∂teborgare, or someone from the area close by. Although they could correctly guess where I'm from because \"I thought we sounded similar, so I just guessed\".\n\nI don't really know what to answer to J√∂nk√∂ping specific words, because most people don't even use them anymore...\n\nEdit: Ett-words that end in -n, I use the ending -a for in the plural definite.

As a beginner, I advise you to focus on these three areas:\n\n1. Help verbs\n2. Personal pronouns \n3. Location prepositions \n\nThe good thing about Swedish grammar is that there are some good patterns to be found to make the learning go a bit smoother."}

Deras spr√•kresurser beh√∂ver d√• inte begr√§nsas av vad som anses vara det ena eller andra spr√•ket, utan de kan v√§xla mellan och blanda ord, uttryck och konstruktioner fr√•n b√•da spr√•ken.\n\nIbland finns attityden att kodv√§xling √§r ett tecken p√• bristande f√∂rm√•ga i m√•lspr√•ket. Det √§r en missuppfattning. I ditt exempel kan vi se att ordet kommer fr√•n engelskan, men att det s√§tts in det svenska grammatiska systemet och b√∂js i preteritum p√• svenska. B√•da bidragen fr√•n b√•da spr√•ken hanteras korrekt: engelskan har r√§tt betydelse, och svenskans grammatik appliceras inte bara korrekt utan ocks√• passande f√∂r svenskans ljudbild.

Man kan allts√• inte heller l√•ta kodv√§xlade uttryck \"r√§cka till,\" utan man b√∂r ocks√• l√§ra sig synonymer som kan f√∂rst√•s av talare som inte delar en egen flerspr√•kighet.

{"prompt": "Doubts about Adjectives", "completion": "Rolig is singular, roliga is plural. En film √§r rolig, tv√• filmer √§r roliga."}
{"prompt": "Doubts about Adjectives", "completion": "What's tripping you up is the difference in congruance (or agreement) between adjectives in attributive and predicative position. You've probably not learnt that difference yet, so it's not strange.\n\nYou might have learnt that when the noun is in the plural form or the definite form (or both), you add an -a at the end of the adjective. So you would write \"en rolig film\", \"tv√• rolig**a** filmer\", \"den rolig**a** filmen\" and \"de tv√• rolig**a** filmerna\".\n\nNow, in the sentence in your example, the noun is in the definite form. By the rules, it should have an -a at the end. But the correct way to say it is actually \"Haha, den filmen var s√• rolig.\" So why is that?\n\nThe reason is that adjectives can be related to their nouns in two different ways, and which way they are related affects their agreement. When the adjective is part of the noun phrase (attributive position), like in all my examples above, it has agreement in both plural and definite forms. However, when it is related to the noun with a copula verb, like \"√§r\" (predicative position), it has agreement with the plural form like usual, but doesn't have agreement with the definite form. Y\n\nour example sentence has the noun in the singular definite form. Singular form doesn't give the adjective an -a ever, and in this position, the definite form doesn't affect it.\n\nSo that's why it's \"rolig\" instead of \"roliga\"."}

{"prompt": "When to start listening to podcasts and consuming other media forms?", "completion": "Although you might not understand every single word at that level, I'd say listening and speaking from the beginning is just as important as reading and writing because it's not just about knowing vocabulary. \n\nListening and speaking helps you learn the rythmn, pitch, pronunciation etc of the language, learning to listen for where one word ends and another begins, and most importantly imo it really helps you practice interpreting/translating at a quicker speed because you don't really have the luxury of rereading/double checking what you're saying, you kinda have to get it right the first time. People generally speak a lot faster than they can write/read so just text input won't really prepare you for following along with an actual conversation, even if you knew all the vocabulary being used in the conversation. From what I've seen and personal experience, I feel like it's really common for people to be pretty good at reading/writing and thinking they'll be fine but as soon as they get into a real conversation it's like reverting back to a full beginner because you just don't have the practice in comprehending or coming up with a sentence at the required speed and without being able to double check everything, not just with Swedish but with any langauge.\n\n  \nSo I definitely recommend listening and speaking from the beginning of learning a language. You can even still have subtitles on and even put the video on half speed when listening until you get to a more comfortable level of vocabulary because you'll still start to get a feel for rhythm and other important things besides just translating the words. \n\nHonestly my favourite way to get listening input is finding songs I really like in the language because you can listen to the same thing over and over again, and you start being able to hear the words as words instead of a jumbled mess. Obvs listening to videos will still work and closer to what a real convo would sound like, but most of the time you'll only really watch those once so you might not get the benefit of starting to separate the sounds into the actual words they're saying, if that makes sense. I've also found the vocabulary generally isn't too hard in songs because they have to get what theyre trying to say across in a succint way rather than long format media where they can take all the time they like and use as many words as they want. Speaking practice is a little trickier to facilitate esp if you're vocabulary is limited, but you can try just speaking to yourself as awkward as that sounds, or this subreddit has a discord where people hang out in voice chats and you can get some practice in :))))"}

The sentence is more smooth and it also gives a tiny statement of what you else do.

With both of them they are in some balance as what you do after a shower. The sentence gets quite direct and takes away all other opportunities if them both are left out. Now it is a much more relaxed way of writing which is to prefer when you write that sentence.\n\nIt is not just a word that fills up some empty space. You could compare it to \"ju\" that is a terrible word in written but in spoken it helps a lot.\n\n\"Det blir *ju* riktigt illa om du tar bort b√•de 's√•' och 'jag' i meningen.\"\n\nBut the whole sentence is really bad as no one would ever write that if they have some clue in \"correct\" Swedish. I am much more annoyed of \"ibland\" in that sentence as it does absolutely not doing anything. And that is because of the alternative what you do if you don't read which in fact describes that reading a book is not what the person do every time after he or she took a shower. If it was stand alone it is necessary as else you always do it. If the person always called the friends after a shower, then \"ibland\" would be needed as that happens sometimes only but calling friends always.\n\nAnd the word \"s√•\" in this example is used as this I think.

If you are unsure how soon something has to be done, you may ask \"Hur l√•ng/mycket tid har jag p√• mig?\" Generally, \"att ha tid p√• sig\" is a positive thing; it means that you don't have to do something right away, and that here is still time left to do it.\n\nCould the sentence work without \"p√• oss\"? I suspect you may get conflicting opinions on that. To me it sounds a bit lacking, so if I would hear it, I would probably fill in \"p√• oss\" from the context. It works a bit better in commands and questions: \"Hur mycket tid har vi?\", \"Ni har tre veckor!\", but again, to my ears, this sounds a bit like hip corporate speech, where \"p√• oss/er\" is shaved off from the utterance for the sake of efficiency, and perhaps also in order to mimic the English idiom (again, to sound hip and modern)."}

{"prompt": "Vi har drygt tre veckor p√• oss.", "completion": "I haven't read the other answers yet so there might be a complete and instructive answer there somewhere. What I just want to say is that \"ha *p√•*\" is a particle verb. Particle verbs is a category of words which always come in two: verb and particle. They are also always emphasised on the second word, the particle.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ha *p√•*\n* g√∂ra *av*\n* s√§tta *p√•*\n* h√§nga *med*\n* h√∂ra *av*\n\nThe tricky thing with particle verbs is that they are often very non-transparent, i.e. it's not immediately obvious what they mean, and it's often something completely different than the meaning of the words themselves when not expressed as a particle verb, i.e. when the second word, the particle, is not emphasised.\n\nFor example the particle verb \"h√§nga *p√•*\" means to join, for example join a friend or a group. The words \"h√§nga p√•\", without the emphasis on the second word, mean to hang onto or latch onto something, like a branch in a tree.\n\nFor us natives this all comes naturally of course and we may not even realise the strangeness of it all, but as a foreigner you really just have to hear these particle verbs often enough to get an intuition for them, and they are *eeeeverywhere*. With this knowledge maybe you'll start seeing them in every other sentence you hear. Experiment to see how the meaning changes with and without emphasis on the particle.\n\nEdit: Just realised you're german. Something tells me you have many particle verbs in your own language as well."}

{"prompt": "How to pronounce \"o\"", "completion": "There is a certain logic to it, although it's not visible in the spelling. In old Swedish, it was possible to have not just VVC and VCC syllables as in modern Swedish, but VC, and VVCC too! Back vowels were much simpler too, and they were pronounced like they are in German.\n\nI'm gonna use macrons to write the long vowels here, and leave short vowels unmarked, and I'll write short consonants with one consonant, and long consonants with two.\n\nIn Old Swedish, there were words with VVCsuch as:  \nlƒÅta,  \nb≈ç,  \nl≈´ta,  \n\nwords with VC such as:  \nagha,  \nsova,\n\nwords with VVCC such as:  \nb≈çtt,  \nƒÅss,  \n\nand words with VCC such as:  \nhatter,  \nloppa,  \n\nWhat happened then, is that the long back vowels shifted in something called \"vokaldansen\" which also happened in Norwegian, but not in Danish, Icelandic or Faroese. ƒÅ shifted to modern long √•, ≈ç to modern long o, and ≈´ to modern long u.\n\nThen, another shift happened, where VVCC syllables were shortened, and VC syllables were lengthened. Thus, the o in sova was lengthened, and the ≈ç in b≈çtt was shortened, giving us the modern pronunciations. The ways in which syllables changed (if VVCC became VVC or VCC) is quite irregular in the standard language, but more regular in dialects. \n\nCompare lƒÅsa and lƒÅst.  \n\nSveam√•l has l√•√•sa and l√•√•st, whereas G√∂tam√•l has l√•√•sa and l√•st.\n\nIf you want to learn more about historical Swedish pronunciation and language, then I can recommend the channel \"Tidsdjupet\" on Youtube.

{"prompt": "How to pronounce \"o\"", "completion": "In general, long vowels are before single consonants, and short vowels are before multiple consonants.\n\nNow keep in mind there are exceptions. Some simple and short words (i.e. kom, √§r, det, etc.) will have short vowels rather than the expected long vowel. And some constant combinations (specifically RD, RT, RL, RS) will take long vowels instead since they're technically one consonant sound, not two."}
{"prompt": "How to pronounce \"o\"", "completion": "Main rule: when you have 2 consonants after the O it's usually \"short o\". For example:\n\nBotten, Lotten, Soppa, Drottning (\"√•\" sound)\n\nAnd when you have 1 consonant or none it would be a \"long o\"\n\nSopa, Ola, Tog, Bok, Ropa, Lo, Bo (\"woo\")\n\nUnfortunately it's not this simple, but I think this will get you pretty far as a default guess. \"Kom\" has a short \"o\" even though there's only one consonant, for example.

We‚Äôve only kept the meaning \"lament\" in the word \"klagos√•ng,\" and even that word is sliding towards the complaint meaning."}
{"prompt": "üé∂Str√∂mkarlen spelar,", "completion": "Sorgerna delar vakan kring berg och dal.\n\nThe sorrows share the wake around mountain and valley.\n\nBasically it means that the mountains and the valleys share between them, the sorrows of someone's wake, presumably one of the lovers' mentioned before who was taken by Str√∂mkarlen. It's very poetically written and doesn't really make sense gramatically, but this is what I infer it to mean.\n\nA vallhorn (usually called a kohorn because it's more specific) is an ancient instrument still played made of a cow's hown with holes drilled into it. It's very challenging to play well, but when it is mastered, it has a wonderfully melancholic tone which carries very well across long distances.\n\nPerhaps due to this cheap- and loudness, it was used for communication, chiefly from a f√§bod (also called a s√§ter) to the larger farmstead. A f√§bod was a smaller house usually a fair way from the main house where cattle were taken in the summer when the grass was depleted at the main farm. This, called \"att valla\" was usually done by young girls, and for communication across long distances, they would use vallhorn.\n\nHere are some videos of kohorn being played:\n\n[https://youtu.be/vNWnh-k80mM?si=554IXdKtG\\_RTcckp](https://youtu.be/vNWnh-k80mM?si=554IXdKtG_RTcckp)\n\n[https://youtu.be/V8OtY2tMa2k?si=I\\_kK7WfxT3ZKheKy](https://youtu.be/V8OtY2tMa2k?si=I_kK7WfxT3ZKheKy)\n\n[https://youtube.com/shorts/-NWmdRk45fg?si=iYLEH01nCMXMF9P\\_](https://youtube.com/shorts/-NWmdRk45fg?si=iYLEH01nCMXMF9P_)\n\nShould these recording sound weird or exotic to you, it's probably because kohorn tunes often use a quite alien scale with weird tunings."}

Adverbs are often formed by using the -t form of an adjective (just like in English, where the adverb really is formed from the adjective real).

{"prompt": "Hej I'm new to Swedish and I'm confused about a few things", "completion": "The difference you are talking about between \"eh\" and \"ah\" might be due to the difference in pronounciation between long and short vowels. In swedish vowel length and quality(i don't remember the phonetical term here) coincide, so if you have the word 'k√§llare' (basement) the vowel '√§' will be short and therefore pronounced as 'eh', while the word '√§r' has a long vowel, thus 'ah'-like pronounciation.\n\nEdit: the word 'k√§llare' is not a good example cuz of how 'k' in beginning of words in swedish can be weird, the word/verb 'h√§lla' is a better example.\n\nColoquially '√§r' is usually just pronounced \"√©\" though so, meh.\n\nIt might also just be a dialectal difference, since that can mess with the percieved sound of the letter."}

I *know* anden (the spirit) and anden (the mallard) are pronounced differently but... Yeah, thinking about it made my head hurt.\n\nFor English though, there is the a/an rule for nouns. It's far more straightforward than en/ett, but the classic trick question in English exams was \"is 'a hour' or 'an hour' correct\"... Also am/are/is.

{"prompt": "Nerd out over Language with me", "completion": "I mean, there's a plethora of examples where we subconsciously use an ending or an article that's incorrect; most would probably say the plural of \"kollega\" is \"kollegor\" in spite of it being \"kolleger\" (My guess is this was constructed back in the day to not make it feminine, even though it's feminine in latin...) and I would say \"ett parallellogram\" even though it's \"en parallellogram\". However, I think this sort of proves it to be a more subconscious pattern recognition, not just having heard the specific word before.\nIf you really want to get annoyed, you should start looking at our old genitive. We used not only to have -s as a genitive, but also -a, -o, -e, -u among others depending on which time period you look at. Now, you'd think these would've gone out of use, but they're still actually pretty common when combining words, think \"tunnelbanEstation\" or \"kvinnOnamn\". This is interesting, as these endings don't fully correspond to the vowel in the plurals and are no longer in use as genitives, yet it often comes intuitively to native speakers, both to use them and often to use the correct ones! \nGood luck learning our quirky language, whose grammar our grammarians so dearly seem to despise!"}

{"prompt": "Medans vs Medan", "completion": "Your partner is completely wrong. \"Medan\" is the right form, and \"medans\" is slang or dialect. I read a lot of novels in Swedish, and the narration always use \"medan\". (And I do mean always.)\n\nI don't know how to say this right, but... someone who doesn't even know the word \"medan\" doesn't speak Swedish well enough to be trusted about other questions about Swedish.  \nIt's one thing if somebody says \"Ain't the bus gonna come soon?\" That's fine to say when talking. But if they tell you that it's grammatically wrong to say \"Isn't the bus going to come soon?\" and that the only correct form is \"Ain't the bus gonna come soon?\", then they don't speak English well enough to teach others. Same principle.\n\nTo finish off, may I recommend a comedy? It's called [*Medan du sov*](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medan_du_sov). :)\n\nEDIT: As an example of the novels thing, I did a search in *Stenhuggaren* by Camilla L√§ckberg, a novel that I haven't read but that is very popular. The word \"medan\" appears 83 times, but the word \"medans\" is never, ever used. So yeah, \"medans\" is only used when talking, or in written text that's no more formal than a spoken conversation. (In my experience, at least.)\n\nEDIT 2: Just to be sure, I also did a search in the children's novel *De sista barnen p√• jorden och zombieparaden* by Max Brailler, which is the Swedish translation of *The last kids on Earth and the zombie parade*. It came out in 2019, so it's newer than *Stenhuggaren*. This book uses \"medan\" 18 times, but never uses \"medans\"."}
{"prompt": "Medans vs Medan", "completion": "Your partner is mistaken ‚Äì *medan* is definitely the standard form. You can see a comparison of frequencies in newspaper text [here](https://zechner.se/frode.cgi?ord=medan+medans&typ=gauss).\n\nThe variant *medans* is sometimes used in spoken Swedish, but serves no particular purpose and won't make you sound more fluent. There's no reason you should ever use it.\n\nI'm not sure where it came from; the only suggestion I can find is that it's a contraction of *medan dess*, in much the same way as *tills* is historically a contraction of *till dess*."}
{"prompt": "Medans vs Medan", "completion": "Go to [svenska.se](http://svenska.se) and type in \"medan\". You'll see it's right there. For extra points you can check \"medans\" too, and realize it is for people who just likes to waste space on the extra letter.  üòâ"}

It's commonly used about chemical production, but can be other things too:  \n*st√•lverket framst√§ller st√•l* \"the steel mill produces steel\"  \nIt can also mean \"describe, depict, portray\", but that's less common than *f√∂rest√§lla*:  \n*tavlan framst√§ller en √§ng* \"the painting shows a meadow\"  \nMore often, that's heard with *som*, and implies that someone might be bending the truth:  \n*filmen framst√§llde det som att hon var rik* \"the film portrayed her as rich\"  \nIn very formal text, *framst√§lla* can also mean \"put forward\":  \n*framst√§lla en beg√§ran* \"make a request\"\n\n*Framf√∂ra* often means *perform*:  \n*jag ska framf√∂ra en aria* \"I'm going to perform an aria\"  \nIt can also mean \"present, express, make known\":  \n*jag ber att f√• framf√∂ra en h√§lsning* \"I'd like to deliver a greeting\"  \n*han framf√∂rde sina inv√§ndningar mot id√©n* \"he brought up his issues with the idea\"  \nAgain, there's a much rarer and more formal sense, which is \"drive (something)\":  \n*k√∂rkort kr√§vs f√∂r att framf√∂ra fordon* \"a driver's licence is required to drive a vehicle\""}

{"prompt": "Is my answer completely wrong or could you say it so?", "completion": "YOU WILL EAT MORE BREADüò°"}
{"prompt": "Is my answer completely wrong or could you say it so?", "completion": "I have consulted a [corpus](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/korp/), and examples like \"En vuxen ska √§ta h√∂gst sex gram salt om dagen\", \"√Ñr ditt l√∂fte att du ska √§ta nyttigare kanske du best√§mmer dig f√∂r att du ska √§ta tre frukter om dagen\", \"Jag svarade precis s√• som jag svara till alla andra , du ska √§ta varierad mat!\" etc exist in abundance. So I think the answer is: it depends on the context.\n\nUsually:\n\nB√∂r/borde: a recommendation, advice, suggestion, own personal opinion, or an expectation based on common sense or previous experiences. Approximately = ska om m√∂jligt/brukar. B√∂r is stronger sounding imo and has a note of a written rule to it, while borde has a note of inner personal sense of right or wrong.\n\nSka/skall: saying/writing something in a prescriptive manner as a doctor, or as to not break the law, or Bible-type of strict codes and guidances. I think especially judging from the examples above, one can use ska in a strong advice but it has a feel of being deeply rooted in logic/common sense/a reasoning of some kind behind it.\n\nThe Duolingo sentence, IF you made it longer and put it into a larger context - I think ska could work. Like \"man beh√∂ver ju √§ta en viss m√§ngd karbohydrater, det √§r inte alls konstigt att du inte m√•r bra. du ska √§ta mer br√∂d\". Although nja I'd still phrase that differently even as a doctor. But I like the example from someone else in the comments: \"Du ska √§ta mer br√∂d, d√• blir du starkare\" - it's the advice deeply rooted in logic and common sense.\n\nAlso if you were retelling someone else's ideas about themselves, like in the second corpus example - then it works: \"menar du att det √§r dags att sluta undvika karbohydrater och att du ska √§ta mer br√∂d?\"\n\nIn conclusion though: as a nerdy thing - yes, contexts where it could (but not necessarily should) be used exist, however as a regular talking thing - probably better to use the word more people would use -> borde."}

{"prompt": "Why do many Swedish place names end in -a though the noun is neuter?", "completion": "The *-a* is an obsolete plural suffix.\n\nWe do not know why, but many Swedish place names use its plural¬†form, even though they are named after a single feature.\n\n\nFor example, the Gothenburg district *Haga* (lit. \"Fields\") was originally named *Hagen* (lit. \"The Field\") but, with time, morphed into its plural form.\n\n\nFrom [Swedish Place Name Lexicon](https://www.isof.se/utforska/publikationer/publikationer/2016-01-01-svenskt-ortnamnslexikon), page 10:\n\n> ***3.3.1. Plural names***\n>\n> *That a place name referring to a location consisting of several different parts may take a plural form is not surprising, e.g. Dellensj√∂arna and Kilsbergen. However, there are a number of place names that have a plural form despite apparently referring to a single entity. These include, above all, many prehistoric settlement names ending in -a, such as Dala and Haga, where -a corresponds to the modern plural suffix -ar. This plural suffix -a, characteristic of place names, also appears in names derived from words that otherwise do not take the plural ending -ar in the language, such as Berga and Husa.*\n>\n> *Not infrequently, older plural place names also feature forms ending in -um and -om, which are fossilised dative plural forms. In Old Swedish, place names were also declined in various cases‚Äîdative occurred, for example, after the preposition i, which is often placed before a place name.*\n>\n> *The reason why so many place names have a plural form despite referring to a single entity is highly debated. There is no consensus on the background of this phenomenon.*\n\n>\n> (Translated by ChatGPT)"}
{"prompt": "Why do many Swedish place names end in -a though the noun is neuter?", "completion": "Not a direct answer to your question, but there‚Äôs a journal, ‚ÄùNamn och bygd‚Äù that focuses on place names, river names and the like.

{"prompt": "Why do many Swedish place names end in -a though the noun is neuter?", "completion": "Because it's a frozen plural genitive that was used after the preposition \"till\". Compare with till sj√∂ss, till skogs, till lands etc. still used in living language as frozen expressions. This is analogous with place names ending in -om (many!) which is frozen plural dative. I think that it was rare that place names froze a nominative form, accusative is probably most common."}

You just have to memorize that when you use \"√∂nska\" to mean \"wish for something\", the *sig* is required.

{"prompt": "How similar are Jamtlandic and Tr√∏ndersk?", "completion": "So this doesn‚Äôt answer your question at all‚Ä¶ but maybe also does a little?  \n\nI am from Berg Municipality in J√§mtland.  I do not speak Jamska but my older relatives born in the early 1900s did, and I still use a J√§mtlandic dialect of Swedish.  I would say that for me, it is as easy or easier to understand a Norwegian-speaker from Trondheim as it is to understand a Swedish speaker from Scania, and also much easier than understanding a Norwegian-speaker from Oslo or god forbid Vestlandet.   But still harder than understanding riksvenska/standard Swedish dialect.   So ‚Äúpretty close‚Äù but our exposure to standard Swedish makes that even easier."}
{"prompt": "How similar are Jamtlandic and Tr√∏ndersk?", "completion": "They share some medieval innovations. Jamning/metaphony to varying degrees, inner Tr√∏ndelag has the \"strongest\", outer Tr√∏ndelag is more similar to J√§mtland. Every landskap Tr√∏ndelag, J√§mtland, √Öngermanland, Medelpad, H√§rjedal, probably some more in Norway has their own system for how exactly it happens, varying also within landskap. \n\nIn more or less all endings, there is a common northern (Norrland above middle of H√§lsingland I think, as well as large parts of Norway including Tr√∏ndelag) innovation to not allow bisyllabicity, that is endings like -ane and -are are just -an and -ar. In Tr√∏ndelag, most of J√§mtland (all dialects except Bergs and Ragunda tingslag) as well as northern Norrland, this is taken a step further, by apocopating all endingvowels after heavy (containing more than one mora (having a long vowel and or more than one consonant (including the same consonant) after the vowel)) stems, if no consonant follows. This leaves only the tone, giving the so called \"circumflex accent\", i.e. tone 2/grav accent (in this case, (rising-)falling-rising(-falling) probably) on just one syllable. Neighbouring dialects also have this, but only through intervocalic loss of especially √∞, so much more sparesly.\n\nThese are the big systematic similarities I know off the top of my head. There is some vocab common also, but I am mot as interested in vocab so I don't remember. \n\nHowever there are also systematic differences. Morphologically, Jamtlandic is overall much more similar to neighbouring Norrland dialects, although morphology differs a bit within J√§mtland also. J√§mtland can be morphologically divided in two large groups, north, containing most north of Storsj√∂n (√Öre, Krokom, Str√∂m, √ñstersund municipalties as well as Ovikens tingslag kind of) and the south of (Bergs, Br√§cke, Ragunda municipalties more or less). They differ morphophonologically in that the north has progressiv jamning, so words ending in -a can have the vowel rounded (this >can< make shortstem weak masculines identical in form to shortstem weak feminines). They differ morpholocially in that the south has r-plural even when there's an endingvowel. South has 1 haga 2 hagar, 1 bakke 2 bakker, 1 fisk 2 fisker, 1 stugu 2 stugur, whereas the north has 1 haga 2 haga, 1 ba-akk 2 ba-akk/bakka, 1 fisk 2 fi-isk/fiska, 1 stugu 2 stugu. Other than this the morphology is similar within the landskap. The southern type declension is identical to Medelpad, Medelpad differs in morphology from it only by having weak neuters take r-plural analogically with the masculines and feminines, and stacking plural + definite endings for weak shortstem masculines (hagar - hagan > hagar - hagaran), but the stacking tendency has spread deep into J√§mtland too. Medelpad also had the same dative endings when the had dative. \nTr√∏ndelag differs a lot from J√§mtland morphologically in allowing all three vowels (a i u) in all declension, where's J√§mtland only does in shortstems, otherwise merging the vowels. At least some of the singular dative endings also differ."}

{"prompt": "How similar are Jamtlandic and Tr√∏ndersk?", "completion": "The whole context is very very different.\n\nIn Norway speaking in a strong accent is seen as a positive, this has a lot to do with the blooming national romantism at the time that Norway became independent. If you walk around in Trondheim the majority of people will speak tr√∂ndersk which is seen as just a dialect and most norwegians can understand them as the language itself is a lot less homogenious.\n\nYou be hard pressed to find anyone actually using Jamska day to day and it's almost completely undecipherable to most Swedes.

If it's any consolation, I learnt a language because of my ex a couple of years ago, and when we broke up, I was devastated but I decided I was going to continue learning his language anyway. I shared my learning progress on socials and it all helped me to connect with other natives and learners. Then my Swedish partner found me because of our love for the language, and now I'm learning Swedish. Things happen in weird and 'magical' ways...\n\nFrom my previous learning experience, I do think online language learning communities are a great way to make friends with natives. Facebook has language groups with helpful people, Instagram has active learners who engage with Swedish teacher accounts (where natives also follow content / help others), and I'm not sure where you're based in the UK but I know in London there are meetups that are organised by different cultural communities, so you could find out on Facebook or Eventbrite about potential Scandi/Swedish groups.\n\nOtherwise, in the past I used HelloTalk and engaged with learners on social media, I'm sure there are Swedish groups on Discord too. It's all about putting yourself in spaces online or in real life where you can meet people who are open to meeting and talking to new people. One thing I would say though, is that as you know, you can't really replace people and it might feel a bit lonely sometimes, but in time you never know what can happen. So keep your head up and find your new rhythm in your own time. Maybe the aim is to continue learning the language so that you may connect with natives more one day, as opposed to trying to find natives - great friendships can be found everywhere :)"}

Svartalver where a kind of gobliny/dwarfy creature from norse mythology that's mentioned in some eddas.\n\nPersonally I prefer to use \"v√§tte\", especially when playing DnD. Then the related hobgoblin and bugbear can be turned into \"illv√§tte\" and \"rese\" respectively.

Neither is correct, but they refer to similar creatures. Use ‚Äùpyssling‚Äù if they are small. Use tomte if they are a household trickster spirit. Use ‚Äù√§lva‚Äù if the are magical.\n\nThe real translations of those words are:\n\nPyssling = Pixie\nTomte = Brownie or gnome\n√Ñlva = Original elf, now it‚Äôs closer to fairy or sprite\n\nAs a side note, the original translation of the Hobbit used the translation ‚Äùv√§tte‚Äù.

Dyka upp means \"show up\" and can be used for expected visits as well, but in both cases, it indicates some type of spontaneous visit - e.g. you showed up at a time of your choosing to an open-door event (such as a club or party) or to a drop-in event."}

They hardly have an \"exact meaning\", and certainly don't translate particularly well.

Allts√• is a filler word with the same function as 'so' in English.\n\nIf you mean their lexical definitions, 'typ' means 'sort' or 'type' or 'kind'. '\n\n'Liksom' you can think of as the two words 'lik' = like and 'som' = 'as' put together. It really just means 'like' or 'just like' or 'in the same way as'.\n\n'Allts√•' means 'so' or 'therefore'. 'I think, therefore I am' = 'Jag t√§nker, allts√• finns jag'."}
{"prompt": "Slang (Typ, liksom, alts√•)", "completion": "*Typ* \"type\" has a few interesting side meanings. Through \"sort of person\", it can mean \"character, guy\", often in a negative way, as in *en konstig typ* \"a weirdo\" or *vilken typ!* \"what a bastard!\". Nowadays, it's commonly used in the sense \"roughly\", much like how \"like\" is used in English ‚Äì *han √§r typ tv√• meter l√•ng* \"he's like two meters tall\". This has also, much like \"like\", become a filler word or general vagueness indicator: *jag ska typ snart g√•* \"I'm, like, leaving soon\".\n\n*Liksom* historically and literally means *like as*, but this is rarely heard now: *han beter sig liksom en hund* \"he acts like a dog\". From there, we get the sense \"as well as; and in the same way\": *Anna var d√§r, liksom Bo* \"Anna was there, and so was Bo\". This is still seen, but quite formal. In more normal text, it can be used to indicate that you're not quite sure about the word, quite like \"so to speak\": *den var liksom gummi-aktig* \"it was kind of rubbery\". That's already not far from being a filler word, but still perfectly normal in a novel etc. Using it more broadly and in other positions in the sentence can make it sound like teenage slag: *men liksom, helt sjukt, liksom!* \"it's like, so sick, you know!\"\n\n*Allts√•* \"thus, therefore\" has a longer history as a filler word, and unlike *typ*, the formal use (\"thus we must conclude...\") and the slang use (\"that's like, so cool!\") are still pretty close. It is often used in explanations or clarifications: *en pudel, allts√• en typ av hund* \"a poodle, that is, a type of dog\"; *han jagar katter, hunden allts√•* \"he chases cats ‚Äì the dog, I mean\". As a slang term, it can at least sometimes indicate surprise: *men wow allts√•!* \"whoa, far out!\" It doesn't have so much the connotation of \"roughly, so to speak\" as the other two.\n\nBeyond that, it's always hard to explain the nuances of how this kind of words are used, so you might have to, like, listen to a lot of people speaking, you know?"}

But at the same time, *stygg* is kind of outdated. *Dum* works better, although you should know that it overlaps with \"stupid\" rather than having an undercurrent of \"evil\" the way \"bad\" does. \n\nSome owners like to talk nonsense to their dogs, e.g. \"Aren't you the naughtiest guy/gal around, yes aren't you?\" in a positive tone, then I'd go with \"stygg\", because it's kinda playful. \n\nEdit: *Stygg* has some sexual connotations because of its playfulness, but that's about humans only."}

In my swedish personality, I tend to mix both fairly \"academical\" words with stupid, outdated slang, maybe swenglish or possibly childish words I find hilarious.\n\nSomething cool I might call \"ballt\" or \"hippt\" which is funny outdated slang. I don't think there's a way I would phrase that someone is \"grumpy\", I would probably call them a bit negative, or jokingly call them  \" en suris\". I regularly call friends or myself \"kn√§ppskalle\" or \"knasboll\" in a friendly way, which means that you're silly or crazy. For someone wierd you might call them \"udda\", \"ett original\" or \"lite egen\" - odd one  out, original or an unusual person. You can also call them \"knepig\", but that has more of a negative connotation. If you do something sorta crazy I would call you bananas. For someone completely unhinged, like if theyre fuming angry or just totally unreasonable, I would call them \"helt rabiat\", \"helt sjuk\" or even \"totalt sinnessjuk, vafan?\"\n\nThe other translations you ask for I probably wouldnt have any special words or slang for, more like literal translations. Someone cute I straight up call s√∂t or gullig. Someone outgoing I would translate to ut√•triktad or social, someone confident is sj√§lvs√§ker, shy is blyg and reserved/quiet is tillbakadragen."}

{"prompt": "Help! I want to sound less like a textbook", "completion": "Moody/Grumpy = Sur! \"Fan va hon va sur idag d√•.\" Great word, fits perfectly, isn't particularly childish (to me, grumpy has a talking-to-a-child vibe in English) just normal. If you're kind of stewing in your anger and upset, then you're sur. Also, if a situation turns out to be disappointing: \"jaha, det var ju surt.\"\n\nMore informal synonyms for moody/grumpy = grinig, bajsn√∂dig (\"in need of a poo\"). The grumpy dwarf in Snow White is called Butter in Swedish, is that anything lol.\n\nHonestly, I can't think of a Swedish word that means 'silly' and doesn't also mean 'crazy'. Here's some: stollig, tokig, kn√§pp. You could use lustig, but it means more like 'funny' in general. Oseri√∂s, maybe, when in disdain perhaps. Knasig means silly, but of a person it's more like someone is silly and you can tell there's something wrong with them. Generally, the way I mostly use the word is like, \"oj, nu blev det knasigt.\"  = \"Whoops, something went wrong.\" In this construction you can also use tokig instead of knasig. Also worth mentioning as a phrase common of native speakers: \"√Ñr n√•t p√• tok?\" = \"Is something not right?\"\n\nWait, I got it, the non-crazy words for silly. Since you said slang: silly person = lallare. To be silly = att lalla. Silly = lallisch (pronounced with a kind of longer a). All of these lean a bit more towards 'ridiculous' or 'unserious' in meaning rather than 'silly'. Emphasis on slang here.\n\nCrazy (with no silly implications) = galen, sjuk, sjuk i huvudet, sinnessjuk, helt fr√•n vettet, har tappat f√∂rst√•ndet. Vansinnig leans more towards angry, not crazy, in my opinion; if you're so angry you're seeing red then you're vansinnig. As a word though, it means 'out of one's mind'.\n\nOne deeply unserious phrase for someone mildly crazy is \"yr i bollen\". Yr is 'dizzy', bollen is 'the ball' (referring to the person's head). Euphemistic and silly phrase. \"Han √§r lite yr i bollen ass√•.\" Another phrase for someone who's not all there: \"ha tomtar p√• loftet\". Tomtar are creatures akin to gnomes, they sneakily do shit around the house basically; loftet is 'the attic' in this case (also referring to the person's head). \"Man kan fan tro han har tomtar p√• loftet.\" This phrase is less silly in tone than the first one, but it's not exactly serious.\n\nWeird/not normal = konstig, udda, underlig, onormal. I'd use stollig and kn√§pp here too, to mean 'aloof'. These are not kind words to describe someone lol.\n\nCute... might be difficult. Like a passing remark on someone's looks? S√∂t, fin. Snygg is more crude (for lack of a better word) since it is 100% for physical looks, but it still works I suppose. You can use all three of those about a stranger. Sk√∂n, h√§rlig = more focused on personality, a bit deeper, about someone you've at least heard talk but still just a passing remark.\n\nNote: gullig is more so for cute animals or cute moments. Do noooot call someone your age or older gullig, unless you are friends. An older person can call you gullig no matter your age if it's a way to thank you, i.e. a quick \"men √•h va du √§r gullig\" when you fetch something they asked for. A child age 0‚Äì10 can also be gullig, in fact I'd say it's the preferred word over s√∂t here.\n\nTo nitpick (seriously take it with a grain of salt), I think s√∂t is more so about looks. If \"ungen var s√∂t,\" then the kid probably had rosy cheeks and a big smile and all that. If \"ungen var gullig,\" then perhaps the kid was also jumping around showing you tricks or drew a picture of the two of you in crayon. In both cases, you'd translate the sentence to \"the kid was cute.\"\n\nIn some cases (when you are talking about someone who did something endearing or admirable) it is okay to call someone older than you gullig. \"S√•g du farbrorn som va med och dansade? Gu s√• han va gullig.\" ‚âà \"Did you see old man who participated in dancing? Gosh that was really cute.\"\n\nI'm trying not to be too black-and-white with gullig, but seriously exert caution because it could be seriously condescending. \n\nConfident/outgoing = sj√§lvs√§ker, social. Pratglad, pratsam, l√§tt att prata med.\n\nQuiet/reserved = tystl√•ten, tystsam, tyst av sig.\n\nShy = blyg, skygg. Skygg is kind of more... primitive? It can be used for an animal too, or a child that doesn't speak and hides behind its mother. Be careful not to drop the g in blyg like some words do. Bly means lead (Pb, atomic number 82).\n\nGood luck!"}

{"prompt": "\"Sorry we were late\" sentence confusion", "completion": "They do pretty much mean the same thing so it's mostly personal preference. If we're being picky, *f√∂rl√•t* is used when you apologize for something you did, like \"please forgive us\", while *ledsen* is used when you're lamenting something unfortunate that you have/had no control over, but people usually don't consider those nuances when using these words."}
{"prompt": "\"Sorry we were late\" sentence confusion", "completion": "\"Ledsen vi var sena\" sounds weird to me if you are saying this as an excuse when you arrive late. This sentence to me heavily suggests you are talking about a oast incident of being late. Like \"Sorry we were late last time, but at least we made it in time this time!\"\n\n\"F√∂rl√•t att vi blev sena\" sounds more like an excuse when you are arriving late. \"Excuse us, we ended up being late\". Literally \"Excuse (us) that we became late\". The thing you are asking forgiveness for is that some delay made you late. This can still be used when talking about a historic event though like \"F√∂rl√•t att vi blev sena sist\" (Sorry we ended up being late last time).\n\nSo I mean, context would determine how you would express this."}

Why? I‚Äôll try to explain. I‚Äôm guessing here that the person is trying to describe being late as something that happened in the recent past that wasn‚Äôt on purpose. ‚ÄúBli‚Äù conveys some of this accidental aspect, like they were made late by accident, they didn‚Äôt mean to be late. Also, I don‚Äôt know how to explain but using ‚Äúvar‚Äù here would make it sound like it happened further back in time, like you were describing something that happened a week ago.

{"prompt": "√Ñn vs -en", "completion": "Swedish, Norwegian, and, to a lesser extent, Danish are among the most phonology-dependent languages in the entire EU because of how important correct intonation is to speak the languages. In Swedish, you not only have to know the individual pitch accent for each word or how the word is stressed, but you also have to know the melody/prosody of the entire sentence. \n\nPitch accent is clear -- \"anden\" (the duck) is different from \"anden\" (the spirit). But also, for example, in \"kamera\", \"-era\" is not stressed, but in -\"era\" verbs like \"resonera,\", -\"era\" is always stressed.\n\n  \nThe melody/\"spr√•kmelodi\" is even harder to put into words, but it describes how Swedes add a second layer of stress and rhythm over entire sentences. Here's my best example, where bolded words are stressed in speech according to the flow and meaning of the sentence:\n\n\"S√• **sa** han att hon **inte** skulle komma f√∂r hon **inte** ville **se** mig igen.\"\n\nFor these reasons, there are entire dimensions of the Swedish language that you won't be exposed to through duolingo in a way that doesn't even apply to other languages that don't have pitch accent and spr√•kmelodi."}

{"prompt": "Dog Commands?", "completion": "Here are some I'm familiar with:\n\nDuktig tjej/pojk = good girl/boy\n\nSitt = sit (the way I learned this is to hold up a hand when you say this, like a stop hand, palm forward, fingers together.)\n\nLigg = lay down\n\nPlats, stilla, v√§nta = (all variants of) stay. (Literally 'place', 'stay still', 'wait', respectively. With plats I'd point somewhere for the dog to stay at that place.)\n\nApport! = go get it! (the game where you throw a toy and the dog goes to get it back to you. Fetch? Maybe point to where you threw it as a gesture.)\n\nStanna/v√§nta = stop/wait (when setting down food, asking the dog to wait before eating. Or throwing a ball and asking the dog to wait before fetching.)\n\nVars√•god = go ahead (when you're setting food in front of the dog and asking it to be patient. When it's welcome to go ahead and eat, vars√•god.)\n\nNej/fy = no, don't do that, stop\n\nNer = come down (from something, like the dog is not supposed to be on the couch, then it's ner. Said sternly, pointing or gesturing to the floor or ground.)\n\nRulla (+runt) = roll (+around)\n\n(+Kolla/titta) hit = Look at me (assertive, gesturing to yourself, assuming the dog is looking elsewhere. 'Hit' is directional, it means 'hither' like in archaic English. It's fine on its own with the right tone but it can also mean 'come here'.)\n\nKom hit = come here (come hither. Said encouragingly, pointing somewhere close.)\n\nKom = come on (said encouragingly, like when the dog is kind of lagging behind and you want it to catch up to you.)\n\nG√• dit = go there (go thither. Point somewhere away from you.)\n\nI'm not all that sure but, literally, \"get the __\" would be \"h√§mta __\". H√§mta bollen = get the ball. H√§mta flaskan = get the bottle.\n\nI've never spoken with a service dog so take all this with a grain of salt!\n\nPlus:\n\nHusse = man dog owner. Refer to yourself as this.\n\nMatte = woman dog owner. Refer to yourself as this.\n\nKind of similar in use to 'daddy' and 'mummy' respectively, but not the same tone, and only used in regards to pets.\n\n\"Ge matte en puss!\" (Give mummy a kiss!)\n\n\"Vart √§r husse?

The app basically just shows you flashcards then you tell it how well you understand/know what it says.

I like that it's actually explaining rules which most other apps don't do."}

{"prompt": "has anyone tried Mjolnir?", "completion": "I have been using it. Used it up until I was invited to pay. I did subscribe:\n\nI found that I had a much much better starting base than what for example Duolingo or Memerise offers \n\nThey give you like 2 starter lessons, I think it was pronunciation and common words,  all the lessons: you complete them at your pace. \n\nIt works like with a flashcard system. I see it helpful as it will pull them out to you after a certain amount of time to test both your understanding of the language and your retention of the information. \n\nThat last part has been key for me, I can now randomly be chilling out and have no worry of forgetting or feeling let down because I messed up of the confirming the flashcards.\n\nIt's not a points/gamified experience. That for me personally works so much better as I can focus on the content of the lessons. \n\nImportant thing to know: you get limited per day how much material you can cover from the lessons. They have great explanations on the app on what the basis for this is for. \nWhat I got from it: avoid burning out, keeping your study limited to increase the quality of your learning.\n\nIf you miss a day, you'll get the cards from that day you missed along with the ones for the day you're getting back to studying. That has helped me be consistent with my studying and also has allowed me to get interested in immersion into Swedish.\n\nI do not live in a Swedish speaking country nor is there a Swedish community in my city, but I have been able to use the speak to text function with my phone and it understands what I say in Swedish. I think that's a great indicator. \n\nI have used ChatGPT telling it that I wanna confirm if I am saying the phrases correctly and I am, along with the pronunciation.\n\nAll audio portions (plenty of them, most of the cards have them) are done by native speakers, different people with very different voices in pitches and depth. Helps so much to get a real native voice.\n\nOnly thing I did not like as of this moment (could get updated by the developers): no sync between devices yet. I was a former iOS guy and moved to Android this year, wanted to use the app on my iPad since I have on my phone. Yeah, not possible to do yet, the team behind the app is awesome since they let me know with a app notification right away that they did not support syncing on multiple devices.\n\n\nFor me, this app is totally worth it! I have made great progress, I showed a friend who's a language teacher (Spanish, English), confirmed  the quality  of the lessons.\n\nIf you guys have any more questions, let me know! \n\nHa det s√• trevligt tim med svenska min v√§n!

I can't think of any, though; do you remember a sentence you've encountered that uses \"sig\" like this?"}
{"prompt": "Jag/du har p√• mig/dig vs Jag/du har p√• sig", "completion": "Maybe you saw some expression like \"I och f√∂r sig\" ?"}
{"prompt": "Jag/du har p√• mig/dig vs Jag/du har p√• sig", "completion": "I gave this some thought, and agree you must have heard people switch jag or du to man, in which case you also switch mig or dig to sig. I think this is a relic from before the collective decision to drop formal language (du-reformen), because it's almost always communicates something unspoken.\n\nUsing 'man' when you talk about yourself mean that it also includes others in one way or another. It might include the group you're with, or the general population. You might do this to imply that what you're describing is a normal thing most people do, like the other commenters example with the morning routine. \n\nIt can also give a \"I'm a funny guy\"-kinda vibe. If you're invited to a party you might say something like \"det √§r b√§st man tar man p√• sig finkavajen!\" - this is just a light-hearted joke, but it *does* imply that you're excited and understand that some effort is expected. If you say \"ska man √∂ppna en flaska vin till, kanske?\" probably mean that *you* want to open another bottle of wine, but you don't have to say it directly and it rather implies that it's said out of consideration of the whole group's needs and wants.\n\nIt's often used to avoid uncomfortable truths like this. \"N√§, man ska v√§l ta och r√∂ra p√• sig\" is what you say when you understand that someone wants you to leave, or if you want to vaguely imply that you sadly can't stay longer. \n\nI *think* it's more common in the north, but I'm not sure."}

{"prompt": "Jag/du har p√• mig/dig vs Jag/du har p√• sig", "completion": "Don't be so hard on yourself. I don't think it's a brain fart. \"sig\" can be really tricky. Like smaragdskyar said, it can be used in a general sense but still referring to oneself in a \"man\" construction. If we were speaking and you asked me what my morning routine is, I could casually list a couple of things I do by saying something like this:\n\n\"Ja, l√•t mig se... Man g√•r v√§l upp. Tv√§ttar sig, kl√§r sig, g√∂r sig i ordning...  Sedan tar man sig till jobbet p√• n√•got s√§tt.\"\n\nIf you asked me about my morning routine and I answered this, there would for a Swedish speaker be 100% certainty that I was speaking about myself and my mornings, and not what morning routines look like in a general sense. But the reflexive pronoun is \"sig\", and yeah \"sig\" is only 3rd person. \"Han kl√§r sig. Hon g√∂r sig i ordning.\" So it's very plausible that you've come across it somewhere. And when I explain it like this while also studying Italian where everything is tidy and conjugated to the right person... yeah, I can also see that \"sig\" is a mess.

It's fairly common to add an \"-a\" when referring to specifically a woman: en finska, en tyska, en norska etc."}
{"prompt": "Nationality nouns", "completion": "Like with many words, in Swedish as in English, the gendered terms are falling out of fashion. The old system was to use one word as both male and neutral, and one specifically for women, and this is now widely considered inappropriate.\n\nSometimes the old male/default form is being used for both ‚Äì for example, *sk√•despelerska* \"actress\" is now seen by many as dated, and *sk√•despelare* applies to both genders. In other cases, new words gain popularity, like *riksdagsledamot* \"member of parliament\" instead of *riksdagsman*, or various constructions with -*are* instead of -*man*.\n\nIn this case, it's a little complicated. Nationalities generally had a feminine form, although it's usually just the adjective with an -a, like *norska*, *tyska* etc. Those are starting to seem increasingly dated, but are still heard occasionally. (In fact, [this](https://zechner.se/frode.cgi?ord=fransyska&typ=gauss) suggests that *fransyska* fell out of fashion well over a century ago, but there may be other explanations.) At the same time, since many (mis)interpret *-man* as specifically male, calling a woman *fransman* might also feel awkward to some. A more modern alternative might be to say *hon √§r fransk*, but it still feels a bit new and odd (I'm guessing it's influenced by English?), and even odder if used as a plain noun, *jag har tr√§ffat en fransk*. If you want to be entirely formal and avoid upsetting anyone, the best option is probably *hon √§r fr√•n Frankrike* and *jag har tr√§ffat en kvinna fr√•n Frankrike*."}

{"prompt": "How do you use 'skolat'", "completion": "In 33 years of speaking Swedish I have never once used \"har skolat\"."}
{"prompt": "How do you use 'skolat'", "completion": "The older (or very formal) version of ‚Äúska‚Äù is ‚Äúskall‚Äù.\nYou will only ever hear or read the word ‚Äúskola‚Äù (in this sense) if someone is quoting the Bible, using the very archaic formal version of its presens form.\n\nThe reason *some* dictionaries keep the form \"skola(t)\" as supinum and/or infinitiv is because the word ‚Äúska‚Äù is never used in infinitiv or supinum in modern Swedish. If you say it to someone, or write it in a book, I'd say there's a 99% chance a native speaker won't understand at all unless you give an explanation. ‚ÄúSkola‚Äù is also more commonly used as a playful word for ‚Äúeducate‚Äù, and any native listener or reader is most likely to interpret ‚Äúatt skola‚Äù or ‚Äúha skolat‚Äù with this meaning, even if it makes no sense.\n\nI think your teacher is doing you all a disservice by teaching you this word.\n\n\nTL;DR: To answer your question, I'd translate it as ‚Äúhas willed‚Äù or ‚Äúhas shalled‚Äù, and yes, it makes just as little sense in Swedish. How I would use it in a sentence is simply not at all.\n\nThe only correct way to say ‚ÄúI should have done‚Äù is just that: ‚ÄúJag skulle ha gjort‚Äù. Never ‚ÄúJag har skolat‚Äù."}

{"prompt": "How do you use 'skolat'", "completion": "Yeah this is not a word I've ever used. I'm of course aware of its existence but when I read the title I thought you meant skolat as in taught/trained. It's an old word that you don't come across often."}
{"prompt": "How do you use 'skolat'", "completion": "Skolat is a quite old term and seldom used in modern language. \nIt can however be used in replament of \"shall\" and training."}
{"prompt": "How do you use 'skolat'", "completion": "Skola, skolat and skall where much more commonly used before, around the turn of the last century and earlier.\n\nSo while it's technically not incorrect to use it's very archaic and I'd advice against using it unless for funnsies.\n\nTo answer your question I'd translate skolat as \"would have\".\n\nD√§r vi skolat sk√•dat sev√§rdheterna - where we would have seen the sites. \n\nI think a better translation than would could be shall, since they are etymologically related so the use of the word becomes clearer (though, shall is a bit archaic while swedes still use ska, but I digress). I find finding \"sibling words\" makes it easier to fit words in sentences sometimes."}
{"prompt": "How do you use 'skolat'", "completion": "Trivia: Also \"skola\" was the present tense plural form, when we still conjugated verbs in plural.\n\nThis can be seen in some old songs.

{"prompt": "Prepositions", "completion": "This is a normal frustration for *everyone*, sometimes including Swedes. You just have to learn it all individually"}
{"prompt": "Prepositions", "completion": "It's perfectly normal, and that applies to learning just about any language. Prepositions are pretty much always hard. The use is largely just conventional so rarely will they matching one-to-one, and instead have this only partial overlaps. The *prototypical* use of propositions often translate quite well (e.g., \"p√•\" ‚âà \"on\" ‚âà \"en\" ‚âà \"auf\" ‚âà ‚Ä¶), but they all also have other uses that don't overlap well at all. You'll find such discordance on the dialectal level too.  \n\nUltimately prepositions tend to be quite arbitrary. Why would they really be different when referring to things happening \"at night\", \"in the afternoon\", or \"on Friday\"? Why is it perfectly normal to be on a plane, but probably recommended to travel *in* a car?"}

That is all. \n\nThank you for everybody that understood and responded in a kind manner."}
{"prompt": "Prepositions", "completion": "Very normal. Learning prepositions in any language can be super difficult, simply because their meanings (both metaphorical and literal) can easily shift due to their relative ambiguity, so what makes sense for one language may not correlate well in another.\n\nFor example, \"om\" can mean \"about\" in the sense of \"concerning, on the subject of\". (Vi pratar om dig). But when I started learning German, I had to get over the fact that the related word \"um\" doesn't mean the same thing except in specific verb phrases.

We do hear the difference clearly, but I suspect we pronounce *sheep* with initial /…ß/ in that case (a sound pretty much unique to Swedish).\n\n/d í/ like in *judge* usually becomes /j/, especially in the beginning of words.\n\n/√∞/ like in *that* becomes /d/ and /Œ∏/ in *three* becomes /f/ if you're slightly proficient or just /t/ if you're just starting out.\n\nFinally, fumble /w/ and /v/. Present day Swedes overgeneralize to /w/. *Vowel* becomes \"wow-el\". I have never heard the opposite, so I'm not sure it has been a thing in the past but it's a noticeable feature in bad Swedish accents by English speaking actors... \n\nAs for the intonation, you'd have to listen to someone. \n\nI assume you are familiar enough with the phonetics of your own language. Ask away otherwise."}
{"prompt": "help with a Swedish accent ???", "completion": "It's an interesting attempt by the writer! The random \"ja\" are unrealistic, so skip those if you want to sound right; a better option might be \"...or?\" The frequent use of progressive (like \"am not liking\" instead of \"don't like\") is not wrong, although this is maybe a bit over the top. The \"ve vill\" is probably likely for a novice learner in the 1800s, although someone on that level might struggle to produce such a long coherent text. \"Wrong size\" without \"the\" also makes sense, but I guess that should also be \"vrong\". And there's another \"we\" later ‚Äì better to make those consistent!\n\nA couple of ideas to make yourself sound more Swedish, on top of what u/Eliderad mentioned:  \n\\- Overenunciate vowels. Big wide As and Os, sharp Is... Also on unstressed words and letters. For example, \"to-ged-der\" and \"diff-rent\" with clear e sounds, fully pronounced \"they are\", etc.  \n\\- Try to do the R with the tip of the tongue ‚Äì can be tricky, though! Some combinations with R and other consonants make special sounds; in this text, you might do \"girl\" -> \"guhl\" and \"part\" -> \"paht\" like in British English, and \"strangers\" -> \"strangesh\".  \n\\- The first A in \"Africa\" is long, like in \"bar\".  \n\\- I think th -> d makes sense more than th -> f. So \"cloding dat is...\" etc.\n\nOh, and if you want another Youtube video, which serves as a good example of a heavy Swedish accent while also teaching you something completely different, check out [Hans Rosling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w&t=295s&pp=ygUWaGFucyByb3NsaW5nIGJlc3QgbmV3cw%3D%3D)!"}

{"prompt": "What is the best app to learn sweedish?", "completion": "HejSvenska 1-4 is a better option than Duolingo. However, since the app is in Swedish, you may need to look things up yourself if something is unfamiliar."}
{"prompt": "What is the best app to learn sweedish?", "completion": "I'm still at the beginning of my Svenska journey, but I can agree with what our fellow redittors already said.\n\nDuolingo (and any other similar apps, for that matter) is a \"starter resource\". It is good to start learning any language and get to know the basic structures and initial vocabulary, but that's about it. You won't get far if you stick to them as a main resource.\n\nYou can finish Duo's course, if you get into \"swedish-targeted content\" you will probably have a bad time understanding it, as u/MilkIsMyPotion exemplified.\n\nWhile Duolingo has a heavily gamified approach, Babbel is more like a \"tech-textbook\", I liked Babbel much more in terms of content, but it is not, by far, as engaging as Duo. Also, if you expect to use the free Duo version, you will need a lot of patience, the app is a heavy freemium one.\n\nTake a look at Clozemaster and LingQ, I guess they have more context-based approaches that tend to be more valuable for learning.\n\nAlso, Anki is great for repetition practice for tricky or hard words and expressions, but it is more effective when you make your own decks as you learn and watch stuff.  \n  \nOther than that, as it's already been said, look for a good book and contents to watch in Swedish. Subreddit's \"Study resources\"  has all you need in this regard. This immersion paired with a good book will get you more results than an \"app-only\" approach."}
{"prompt": "What is the best app to learn sweedish?", "completion": "SVT, you get a lot of Swedish stuff there for free. Netflix might also help.

Gboard's built-in translator might help you quickly find a word or approximation of a sentence when you need it. Chat GPT for practicing your writing without fear, or even just Google Keep or any other notes app for that matter would do.\nOther than that? Just practice, and immersion."}

{"prompt": "\"Min mamma\" or just \"Mamma\"?", "completion": "We don't use just \"Mamma\" with children \"because\" they don't understand that their mom has a name. Children usually understand this perfectly well (at least at the age where they can talk in full sentences) and are usually even smart enough to infer whose mother someone is referring to.\n\nThis use of \"Mamma\", just like \"Mom\" in English, functions like a proper noun (i.e. a name) and could really refer to the mother of either party of the conversation (the speaker or their main addressee(s)); though, young children generally only use it to refer to their own mother. A mother can even use it to refer to herself when talking to her own child/ren (this use can be extended to other contexts, but mostly for humourous purposes).\n\nIf the mother, M, of some person C is talking to some other person P‚Äîin the presence of C‚Äîand P or M talks about \"Mamma\", even a young child will figure out that they are probably referring not to M but to their own mother, or to the mother of the other party.\n\nThis can often get a bit more confusing with things like \"Farfar\" (paternal grandfather), especially when three or more generations of the same family are present."}

I don't think the pronunciation or grammar are very challenging compared to say, Russian, and it's always gratifying to be able to make yourself understood without having them resort to English. Getting to speak with native speakers in Swedish without that happening probably takes a bit longer because they're interested in efficient communication too, but even the small efforts I made seemed appreciated and they generally humored and spoke back to me in Swedish when I traveled there. On the disadvantages again: depending where you are it can be hard to find classes or a teacher. It's not always easy to find Swedish language media that's personally interesting, though maybe im missing some resources,  and again, a lack of natives to practice with is a concern, but noticing progress as you go is really fulfilling."}

However, while there's a lot of spoken English here, written or online is a completely different story - very little of that is in English (which is entirely fair).\n\nAs to how useful it is ... at time of writing Sweden has a population of about 10.5 million, and it's the only country which uses the language. Danish & Norwegian are reasonably similar, but they're about 5 million each, and there's some overlap (I hear) with Finnish, another 5 million. So potentially 4 countries totalling 25 million people.

In English and many other languages we're used to adding \"please\" as we see it as polite. Here, as I was explained, having just \"sn√§lla\" is more of what kids say when they drag their parents' sleeves and ask for stuff. If you must be extra polite FAQ has good examples like \"√§r du sn√§ll\" and \"om du kan vara (s√•) sn√§ll\". But honestly, just adding thank you - tack - at the end of your request usually works perfectly great.\n\nOne can also go a step further and make your request even more indirect/polite and do something like \"*kan man f√•* lite vatten?\" - for example. Then you'll either be told where to get it for yourself or offered a glass, and you can thank for either reply. That's like the most \"i don't want to be a bother\" version of politeness imo."}

{"prompt": "K√§nner v K√§nner till v Vet", "completion": "May I suggest using ChatGPT to help with your studies? I'm a native English speaker who's lived many years in Sweden and I speak the language fluently. Now I'm learning Danish, and I've recently discovered how incredibly useful AI is to get very thorough answers to questions like this. Here's an example:\n\nPrompt to ChatGPT:\nExplain for an English-speaker the different Swedish words for \"know\", i.e. 'k√§nna', k√§nna till' and 'vet'\nAnswer:\nGreat question! In Swedish, there are a few different words for ‚Äúknow,‚Äù and they are used in different contexts. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:\n1. K√§nna ‚Äì ‚ÄúTo know‚Äù in a personal or emotional way\n‚Ä¢ This verb is used when talking about knowing a person, being familiar with someone on a personal level, or having an emotional connection to something.\n‚Ä¢ It literally means ‚Äúto feel‚Äù and is related to emotions and relationships.\nExamples:\n‚Ä¢ Jag k√§nner honom. ‚Äì ‚ÄúI know him.‚Äù (As in, I am personally acquainted with him.)\n‚Ä¢ K√§nner du Anna? ‚Äì ‚ÄúDo you know Anna?‚Äù (Meaning, have you met her before?)\n‚Ä¢ Jag k√§nner mig tr√∂tt. ‚Äì ‚ÄúI feel tired.‚Äù (Here, it keeps its meaning of ‚Äúfeel.‚Äù)\n\n2. K√§nna till ‚Äì ‚ÄúTo be aware of‚Äù or ‚Äúto have heard of‚Äù\n‚Ä¢ This phrase is used when you know of something or someone but do not necessarily have a deep or personal understanding.\n‚Ä¢ It implies surface-level knowledge or awareness.\nExamples:\n‚Ä¢ Jag k√§nner till den h√§r staden. ‚Äì ‚ÄúI know of this city.‚Äù (Meaning, I‚Äôm aware of it but might not know it in detail.)\n‚Ä¢ K√§nner du till den h√§r f√∂rfattaren? ‚Äì ‚ÄúDo you know of this author?‚Äù (Have you heard of them?)\n‚Ä¢ Jag k√§nner till problemet, men jag vet inte hur man l√∂ser det. ‚Äì ‚ÄúI am aware of the problem, but I don‚Äôt know how to solve it.‚Äù\n\n3. Veta ‚Äì ‚ÄúTo know‚Äù as a fact\n‚Ä¢ This is used when talking about knowledge of facts, information, or certainty.\n‚Ä¢ It is followed by a subordinate clause (att = ‚Äúthat‚Äù) or a question word (vad, hur, var, etc.).\nExamples:\n‚Ä¢ Jag vet att det √§r sant. ‚Äì ‚ÄúI know that it is true.‚Äù\n‚Ä¢ Vet du var hon bor? ‚Äì ‚ÄúDo you know where she lives?‚Äù\n‚Ä¢ Jag vet inte. ‚Äì ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù\nA related form:\n‚Ä¢ Veta om ‚Äì ‚ÄúTo be aware of‚Äù\n‚Ä¢ Example: Vet du om det blir regn i morgon? ‚Äì ‚ÄúDo you know if it will rain tomorrow?‚Äù\n********\nAnd once you're looking up questions this way, consider using Anki to create flashcards so you can review to make the knowledge stick. \nOne last thing: Learning Scandinavian, with all the vowel sounds, means you should devote a lot of time to listening to media. Back when I was learning Swedish that meant choosing between three radio and two TV channels. You young'uns have a lot more options."}

{"prompt": "Would you use the term \"bist√•nd\" to refer only to financial aid?", "completion": "Yes, it roughly means aid/help and it‚Äôs most often used in contexts such as financial aid."}
{"prompt": "Would you use the term \"bist√•nd\" to refer only to financial aid?", "completion": "I would also use it for food, medicine, blankets and such. But mostly when it‚Äôs about help in a larger scale and when it‚Äôs a catastrophe like war, famine and such. If I help a family member who can‚Äôt pay their rent for a month I wouldn‚Äôt really call it bist√•nd."}
{"prompt": "Would you use the term \"bist√•nd\" to refer only to financial aid?", "completion": "Bi comes from 2, like binary, st√• is stand, so bist√• actually comes from stand by one other (two togheter). So then bist√• has to mean a relation that takes two. \n\nThen as one is related to one more = two, the term bist√• is used for help or service like how can I bist√• you (hur kan jag bist√• dig (stand by you))  \n\nYes you could say \"gud bist√• mig\", and it would be correct but usually people in that frase would say st√• vid min sida (which means exacly the same: stand by my side) or people say help me (hj√§lp mig).  Because it's a relation that takes two and one are dependent of the other, this has emerged to sometimes (often) be interchangable to hj√§lp. \n\nEven so one is aided by the other in a binary relation. \n\nBist√•-nd= Bist√•nd, where -nd gives that this a specific: the bist√•, that is. \n\nSo bist√•nd then becomes a specific such one to one other relation. To say \"god bist√•nd me\" is not correct, since that would mean \"God the help me\" or \"God the stand by my side\", the \"the\" = -nd makes it not work.\n\nIn government terms a bist√•nd, is used for somekind of aid between the government body and another, which could be one group or one person.\n\nSo \"Bist√•nd\" is not in specific cash support but could be any kind of service they give to you. Like a bist√•ndsbeslut means a decition about some kind of aid from that body to one other.\n\nSocialbidrag, as some people said is just one kind of, and  actually one spesific (Socialtj√§nsten) government body can grant anouther and means financialy support to survive and not live in total poverty.\n\nSo just one kind and not at all = to bist√•nd or bist√•."}
{"prompt": "Would you use the term \"bist√•nd\" to refer only to financial aid?", "completion": "Att \"st√• n√•gon bi\" or \"bist√•\" means to stand by someone (to help). It can be used for any kind of help though it's quite archaic. Bist√•nd as a noun can also be used for different kinds of aid, but is hardly ever used for anything other than financial aid or foreign/disaster support (not strictly financial but I guess if you send beds and tents or vaccines, there is still a very financial aspect). You probably read it in relation to God because the language around religious stuff tends to be a bit more archaic."}

{"prompt": "Would you use the term \"bist√•nd\" to refer only to financial aid?", "completion": "Sverige ger ekonomiskt bist√•nd och humanit√§r hj√§lp till xxxx\n\nJag gick in och hj√§lpte honom ekonomiskt.\n\nJag st√∂ttade honom ekonomiskt.\n\nHan g√•r p√• bidrag (vardagligt)\n\n= bist√•nd, st√∂tta (support), bidrag\n\nBut to answer your question (someone correct me if I'm wrong):\nWhen it's conjugated to \"bist√•nd\" I associate that to the state financing something with economic aid, but I guess it can be other (material) help too.. But if you use \"bist√•\" (verb) (lit.\"Stand by\" = provide\"  it can be other things, but then it will always be followed by a noun. (Like \"bist√•\" with educational programs)"}

{"prompt": "Flamma v L√•ga", "completion": "*L√•ga* = a flame that burns consistently: \n\n*T√§nd l√•gan p√• spisen.* \"Light the flame on the stove\", \n\n*Huset stod i l√•gor.* \"The house was on fire\"\n\n*Vi satt och tittade p√• l√•gorna.* \"We sat watching the flames\"\n\n*Flamma* = a transitory flame, like a fire that flares up and then settles down. I may be wrong but it feels like it is more used in the verb sense: *att flamma (upp)*\n\n*Han h√§llde p√• bensin s√• att brasan flammade upp. \"He poured gasoline on the fire so it flared up.\"*\n\n*Hon s√•g en liten flamma och fortsatte att bl√•sa luft i elden.* \"She saw a small flame and kept blowing oxygen on the fire.\"\n\n*Flamma c*an also be use just as in English to refer to a short-term love interest, often in the past:\n\n‚Äì *Annika*, v*em √§r det?* ‚Äì √Ñsch, e*n gammal flamma bara. \"Annika, who's that?\" \"Uh you know, just an old flame.\"*\n\n*Gl√∂d =* this does **not** mean flame. Instead, think of the verb *att gl√∂da* \"to glow\"; in fact, it usually means that there is a **glow, but no visible flames**.

{"prompt": "Flamma v L√•ga", "completion": "I would say (and SAOB seems to agree with me) that flamma is a l√•ga, but a l√•ga is not always a flamma. Flamma is a larger, more uncontrolled type of l√•ga.\n\nThe flame of a candle for example would always be called a l√•ga, never a flame. But the fire in a fire place or when a house is burning could referred to as having l√•gor or flammor. (‚ÄùHan sl√§ngde brevet i eldens l√•gor‚Äù alternativt ‚ÄùHan sl√§ngde brevet i den flammande elden‚Äù)."}
{"prompt": "Flamma v L√•ga", "completion": "\"Flamma\" and \"l√•ga\" are essentially the same thing, which is \"flame.\" Flamma might be a bit more flickering and moving, while l√•ga is calmer and more consistent, but they're rather interchangable.\n\n\"Gl√∂d,\" however, is when it burns without a flame, like the embers of a grill. There should be no flame."}
{"prompt": "Flamma v L√•ga", "completion": "Yes, both flamma and l√•ga mean ‚Äúflame‚Äù. L√•ga comes from an older Norse word, and flamma is a loan from German. But they are used more or less interchangeably. ‚ÄúGl√∂d‚Äù is the glowing light from ember."}
{"prompt": "Flamma v L√•ga", "completion": "Mostly synonyms I would say (if talking about the substantive describing flames from fires). \n\nFlamma is a lick of flame. More often used about fires. Do not that it can be used as a verb or adjective as well. You could say \"flammande l√•ga\" for instance like in this product:https://www.clasohlson.com/se/Blockljus-LED-med-flammande-l%C3%A5ga/p/Pr442199001 where it descrives a vafting flame.\n\nL√•ga can also be a verb, though I rarely see it in practical use, describing an intense burning.\n\nFor some compound words you would only use one of the words. Like you would say \"svetsl√•ga\" (the \"flame\" from a blowtorch), not svetsflamma. Though I could say that \"svetsl√•gan flammade till/upp\" (the blowtorch flame flared up).\n\nIn general I would say a \"l√•ga\" is more focused, while a \"flamma\" is more wild.\n\nEdit: \"gl√∂d\" btw is glow or embers. If \"elden gl√∂der\", then the fire is likely just glowing embers. Though \"gl√∂der\" could be used to describe a light bulb glowing. \"Det var bara gl√∂d kvar av elden\" would be \"There was only embers left of the fire\"."}
{"prompt": "Flamma v L√•ga", "completion": "If you light a new candle it might *flamma* upp at first but when the wick has burned down it burns with a steady *l√•ga*. A while later, when you blow the candle out you might see some *gl√∂d* at the tip of the wick."}
{"prompt": "Flamma v L√•ga", "completion": "Everything above is correct, I'm just going to pipe in with *gl√∂d*.\n\n*Gl√∂d* is \"ember\". (\"Smoulder\" is *pyra*.)\n\n>*Bara pyrande* ***gl√∂d*** *√•terstod av huset.*  \nJust smouldering **ember** remained of the house.\n\nAs said, *gl√∂d* can also mean \"glow\"\n\n>***Gl√∂d****lampan avgav bara en svag* ***gl√∂d***.  \nThe light bulb (lit. \"**ember**\\-lamp\") only emitted a weak **glow**.\n\nIdiomatic *gl√∂d* can also be translated to \"flames\" or \"passion\"\n\n>*Jag s√•g* ***gl√∂den*** *in hans √∂gon.*  \nI saw the **flames** in his eyes."}
{"prompt": "Flamma v L√•ga", "completion": "I don't know if it's the real meaning of the word, but flamma is usually used for a temporary state while l√•ga is a temporary state.\n\nFlamma is usually used in the same way that you use flicker (flamma till) or when it suddenly grows in size (like when the candle begins to burn).\n\nThink of flamma as flammable and l√•ga as flame. It is not correct, but it gives an idea of when to use which.\n\nRegardless, most Swedish people would know what you meant to say if you mix the words up."}

{"prompt": "How can I learn swedish as a german?", "completion": "I would definitely say that Swedish is one of the easier languages a native German speaker could learn. Definitely much easier than English. It feels like the vast majority of vocabulary can be easily derived from German.¬†I also recommend this video: https://youtu.be/EIO7sphQ3wM?si=vYX3mKpvi8XqGeuA. Additionally, the grammar is much simpler than in German and not as distant as English grammar.\n\nThe YouTube channel Sprich Mal Schwedisch has great explanatory videos in German about Swedish and Swedish habits, which could be a good starting point.\n\nAs a German speaker, it‚Äôs especially important to focus on proper intonation and pronunciation. It‚Äôs much more beneficial to pronounce a word correctly and understandably than to construct a completely grammatically correct sentence but pronounce it poorly."}

{"prompt": "How can I learn swedish as a german?", "completion": "i think you'll find it's an advantage. the perceived difficulty of a language is certainly relative to one's first language (L1).  I'm a native English speaker and am comfortable with German (probably C1/C2). I have been plugging away at learning Swedish for a few months now. German definately helps: you will see many (>30%) cognates. Verbs will be similar or easy to guess. I am using Babbel, and YouTube. There are plenty of shows on Netflix, etc with subtitles. Podcasts for new Swedish speakers. As long as you have patience and motivation, you can progress."}

The majority of the vocabulary is identical or similar to at least one of these.

{"prompt": "I want to learn a Nordic language , few questions", "completion": "I am from Lithuania but i moved to sweden because of my partner. I learned a small part of language in SFI (school that you can attend in Sweden), the other part was through duolingo, talking with my partner and his family and spending hours on youtube and internet looking for info. It wasn't easy with the pronunciation, the grammar was little bit hard too, but i guess this is how it is with every other language. I really wanted to learn Swedish so I would say the 'wanting part' to learn something new also plays a big role - if you want it, you can achieve it. \n\nI am far away from being very fluent in swedish, but I can speak it and from how much i know swedish i can understand norwegian too. They have similar words. \n\nI know lithuanian, english, swedish and little bit of russian. I would say swedish to me is like english its just that it was slightly harder to learn it since i started not at young age (we start to learn english when we are like 10 in school and i strated swedish when i was 19). \n\nAlso just to throw it in here - when i was learning russian in school i didnt think it was hard, or that the alphabet was hard. To others it is very hard. So I would say all of the learning proccess depends on you - on how much you want it, how much time you spend doing it and what resources you have."}

{"prompt": "I want to learn a Nordic language , few questions", "completion": "Some features of Swedish make it very nice to learn. The verb conjugation is pretty simple for example. Other things, like word order changing depending on how you order your clauses, often take longer to feel comfortable with. It has loan words from English and French, plus connections to German, which help for some.\n\n\nI think Swedish is classified alongside Spanish, French, Italian etc. as being relatively quick for an English speaker to learn. Polish is seen as harder.

So, would Finnish not be the same at all?\n\nComparing the languages to English you can say that Norwegian and Swedish are roughly as similar (or slightly less than) as British and American English. And Danish would be the Jamaican of the Nordics. While Finnish and Swedish would be as similar as Polish and English.\n\nIf you have English as a native language you'll recognize a lot of words and the structure of Swedish.

{"prompt": "Reflexive Pronouns som, d√§r and vilken/vilket/vilka", "completion": "The first three examples are good for setting guidelines and (contradictory to your statement) as you see in the sentences, you can't use the reflexive pronouns interchangeably since the sentence-construction changes slightly depending on the reflexive pronoun:\n- vilken/vilket/vilka = which, who\n- d√§r = where\n- som = used in most cases and can often be translated to \"that\" or \"who\" in English; used where you don't use either which or where\n\nSo with this in mind, the examples you put about the father who is a teacher can be like this:\n- min pappa, som √§r l√§rare, undervisade idag = my father, that/who is a teacher, was teaching today\n- min pappa, vilken √§r l√§rare, undervisade idag = my father, who is a teacher, was teaching today\n\n\"Ig√•r, d√§r\" is a weird combination and I don't know where you got it from.

Take a look at the sentence I wrote to describe the reflexive pronoun \"som\" and let's translate it to Swedish: \"\"som\" is used where you don't use either which or where\" = \"\"som\" anv√§nds d√§r man inte anv√§nder varken vilket/vilken/vilka eller d√§r\". In this case, \"d√§r\" can also be replaced with \"n√§r\" (when) and \"i de fall [d√§r]\" (in the cases [where]), just like in English.\n\nPS: it should be \"ifjol\", not \"ifj√∂l\""}

And like in English, you can even omit it entirely: \"det √§r staden jag √§r f√∂dd i\".\n\n\"d√§r\" is more specific and can only really be used with places, not times.  For times you could use \"d√•\" or \"n√§r\".  For \"whose\" you can use \"vars\".  \n\n\"vilken\" here may be technically correct, but I think way more uncommon than the other constructions."}

It's also a fairly easy read even for learners, despite being oriented toward natives. \n\nFor more formal studies on grannspr√•ksf√∂rst√•else, the most well-cited is Delsing and Lundin 2005: \"H√•ller spr√•ket ihop Norden? : en forskningsrapport om ungdomars f√∂rst√•else av danska, svenska och norska.\"\n\nThe language is more oblique, but it's definitely worth reading if you're interested in the topic. I could recommend many more similar articles that built on the 2005 study."}

{"prompt": "SFI vs Folkuniversitet vs Private Course", "completion": "SFI is a good option if that's the only option you have. The quality varies wildly between cities, regions, and even between schools in the same area. There *are* good teachers there, excellent even, but it's not easy finding them. \n\nFolkuniversitetet is more \"formal\". It follows Rivstart from beginning to end and most people in your class will be on your level, which means the room for conversation increases compared to SFI. \n\nHowever, in my experience it's limiting to only follow Rivstart because the A1A2 book isn't that great, not even the latest edition. Rivstart is the equivalent of a meal at McDonald's. You know what you're gonna get but it won't be fulfilling and you'll soon be hungry for more. \n\nPrivate studies can be hit and miss, depending on who you go with. The advantage of going private is that you get lessons tailored to *your* needs, not the needs of 25 people. This means a greater choice of learning material and more creative ways of looking at your studies that suit you. Another advantage is that you don't have to travel because everything is done online. \n\nThe con is that you only speak to the teacher and don't have as many, or any, group discussions. There are several platforms out there that offer private lessons and one quick google search will hopefully give you the best ones.\n\nGood luck!"}
{"prompt": "SFI vs Folkuniversitet vs Private Course", "completion": "Folkuniversitet also follows Rivstart A1/A2. Depending on the region you wish to study depends what courses are on offer. For example one region may offer extra intensive at 5 hours study per day at school for two weeks or intensive which is 2 hours per day plus homework. Other regions offer different/similar.\n\nA1 is very basic Swedish and is more about the grammar in preparation for A2 and B1. \n\nFrom my experience the folkuniversitet course is well delivered if you put your own time to learning extra outside of school. You‚Äôll benefit greatly. The classes have up to 16 people and with daily exercises to speak Swedish between 2-3 of you.\n\nAdditionally, if you have no one to practice with at home but wish to practice your pronunciation. You can check out Swedish with Anastasia on YouTube although she follows Rivstart second edition (most recent is the third edition) most of the context is the same for what is being delivered in terms of pronunciations."}

{"prompt": "that's one interesting translation ", "completion": "I won‚Äôt claim to know what‚Äôs the case with modern flag terminology (vexillology, iirc), but at least in heraldry,¬†gold is absolutely the correct term.

Gold and silver are metals, red, blue, green, etc are colours, and since you can‚Äôt always paint or render gold and silver, yellow and white, respectively, are used in their place, but heraldically speaking, they still count as gold and silver.\n\nA quick google search also says that the German flag is officially defined as black, red, and gold, not yellow.

{"prompt": "that's one interesting translation ", "completion": "Their constitution is wrong then. üòâ\n\nNah, but yeah, I maintain that gold isn't actually a color.

{"prompt": "Using ‚Äùser ut‚Äù eller ‚Äùverkar‚Äù to describe impressions of people ", "completion": "Yup, *ser ut* when used directly about a person would almost always be taken as a statement about how someone physically looks, while *verkar* is about seeming and more to do with demeanor and how the person acts.\n\nPretty much the same as in English, i.e. \"Du ser ledsen ut\" = \"You look sad\" and \"Du verkar ledsen\" = \"You seem sad.\"\n\nedit:  There's also a particular use of *ser ut* that corresponds to the English \"looks to be\". \"Han ser ut att vara r√§tt man f√∂r jobbet\" - \"He looks to be the right man for the job\". This is mostly a literary phrasing in English from what I've seen, but is less so in Swedish. You can of course use *verkar*/seems like in this case as well.\n\nJust wanted to add an example where *ser ut* isn't directly about visual appearance.

{"prompt": "pls help with a word in a song...", "completion": "I agree with you it sounds a bit like cikadorna, but I think she pronounced it in a way where the n fell away a bit. Many pronounce signalerna as singnalerna, but she did a hard g and so the n went soft. That‚Äôs my guess."}

The latter is used when talking about two or more subjects doing something together.\n\n*Kalle tr√§ffar Lisa* \\- Kalle meets Lisa.\n\n*Kalle och Lisa tr√§ffas* \\- Kalle and Lisa meet (or are meeting).\n\nThere's **a lot** of nuance and different cases where you'd use one over the other, and no iron-clad rule that covers every use. Any answers you get here will be very general, and you should not be surprised to see one or the other used where you didn't expect it.\n\nIf we stick with how they're used about people meeting each other, *m√∂tas* is generally more formal and/or literary than *tr√§ffas*, but that doesn't mean that *m√∂tas* is always formal.\n\nIn most cases where you meet someone - informally, socially, at a gathering, to hang out, to do something together - you would use *tr√§ffas*.\n\nThis goes for when you \"see\" someone socially in English as well.\n\n*Jag ska tr√§ffa Karin ikv√§ll* \\- I'm seeing Karin tonight.\n\nIn everyday speech, att *m√∂ta/m√∂tas* tends to more often be used about the physical dimension of an encounter, but in many cases you can se *tr√§ffa/tr√§ffas* as well.\n\n*Jag m√∂tte/tr√§ffade Lars p√• v√§g till aff√§ren* \\- I met Lars on the way to the store.\n\nWhen meeting **up** with someone, you would usually use *m√∂ta*.\n\n*Jag m√∂ter dig vid t√•gstationen -* I'll meet (up with) you at the train station.\n\nWhen not talking about people meeting each other you use *m√∂ta*.\n\n*V√•ra √∂gon m√∂ttes och jag visste att jag var f√∂r√§lskad -* Our eyes met and I knew I was in love.\n\nThis hopefully gives you some idea, but don't take any of it as written in stone."}

{"prompt": "Wanting to learn Swedish ", "completion": "Download Anki and get the A1-A2 Swedish deck as it includes audio to help you get used to the pronunciation. Purchase a grammar book to learn the basics. As you learn more vocabulary, start reading news articles on 8-Sidor, and translate the parts you don‚Äôt understand. It‚Äôs a good method because articles often cover the same topics so it reinforces your vocabulary. Duolingo is OK - but simply to get the very basic phrases learnt. \n\nSimple Swedish Podcast is a fantastic listening resource (reading too, if you sub to his transcripts). I have learnt a lot through his episodes.\n\nI use a VPN and watch shows on SVT. Might not be a popular choice, but V√§stra Gymnasiet is a young adult show but the episodes are only 15 minutes long and even without knowing much of the language, you can infer a lot from context. It was a good way to learn more colloquial talk too.\n\nBeen learning for nearly a year and I can comfortably watch TV (with Swedish subs) and read texts - I am currently reading Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. I still have to translate every now and then, but it has come along leaps and bounds. Lycka till.\n\nEdit: I should add this is a daily thing for me.

There is also a great newspaper called 8 Sidor, which is written in easy Swedish and helps a lot for beginners.\n\nHowever, it is really hard to reach C1 or C2 level Swedish without living in Sweden. (I assume you want to find a job position that requires Swedish.) I also came to Sweden years ago as a highly qualified worker (I am an engineer too). Most companies accept English for high-qualified jobs, especially in engineering. You can find a job in English and start learning Swedish after you find a job. I would say that finding a job in English and learning Swedish in Sweden is much easier.\n\nI have been studying Swedish for nearly 1.5 years and I am able to have basic conversations. You can also apply for SFI (Swedish for Immigrants) classes if you have a work permit, which can help you improve your Swedish much faster.

The fun stuff like slang, colloquial phrases, I think, are best learned after you have a decent base in the language. The most popular one seems to be the RIV START series, which I'm using right now. Although they're meant for the classroom, with a little help from Google Translate, a dictionary and a grammar reference book, I've been able to use it well. \n\nComplete Swedish is another popular one and that one has explanations in English. \n\nMeanwhile, find media that you like in Swedish.

Vocab is a bit light but I'm probably more confident in being able to accomplish some simple conversations (what time is it, how much does that cost, do you want to get some food, etc) than I was after a year of taking (and only barely passing) French in uni. \n\nEach person will have their own preferred method so it's not a panacea but I'm definitely having more fun with this so far than my other failed attempts at other languages using other methods."}

Afterwards it gets pretty useless though (only vocabulary) but you are good enough then to continue by just watching Swedish media which is the best way to learn anyway.\n\nWhen you are good enough the best deal is to buy a VPN subscription that tunnels you into Sweden to circumvent geoblocking of SVT Play. There‚Äôs a huge amount of free content, much more than on something like Netflix. And you always get subtitles. In contrary to broadcasters like BBC or NHK they don‚Äôt fight VPNs at all.

Normally you would say \"de blyga violerna\", but it also works with \"violerna blyga\" or \"violerna de blyga\".\n\nThe second thing is that \"en blyg viol\" is a Swedish expression for a shy person, a \"shrinking violet\" or a \"wallflower\", so violets are associated with the adjective shy, much how like roses are associated with the adjective red."}

It's \"okay\" to get started for a couple of months max. I agree with you that even in that aspect it's quite poor overall as a result of the changes of the past few years. There's a cult mentality with it though and some just use it over and over (with those same example sentences) for years to extend streaks but learn nothing of substance after a point.\n\nMemrise is one I've not used as much since they revised it all. I do love the native speakers videos and clips. I did have some issues with some mistakes that were not being corrected after *years* of reporting them there, hopefully they have done so. At the time it was because the main, non-video, speaker had not been back to correct some things. Nothing ground breaking though. I don't think it's ideal for someone completely new to the language though. Maybe a quick intro round with Duo. \n\nBabbel is solid for intro to mid level Swedish course. It's very polished but there is no free tier. \n\nOnce people have some experience Clozemaster is nice and gives you , quite literally, tens of thousands of potential Swedish sentences. Sadly it uses TTS voices but still, it's so deep it's great practice and exposure to new things as you learn elsewhere. \n\nLingQ and Glossika are nice for those people that are super motivated and can take people from fairly early stages to more advanced ones."}

Upplevelse would probably be best.

You can have \"d√•liga erfarenheter\" from something, which means that you've actively/consciously tried it, but here's the good, and here's the bad. For example, if you buy a car and have lots of trouble with it, you have learned \"d√•liga erfarenheter\" of that model and brand.\n\nI would use \"d√•lig upplevelse\" about a singular activity, a movie or a theatre play or a concert, that turned out to be a disappointment.

{"prompt": "‚ÄúHon‚Äù as object in a sentence?", "completion": "Note that in English, the formal (and some would say more correct) way to express things like this is basically identical to how Swedish does it.

It‚Äôs also called the ‚Äúnominative.‚Äù That means it is correct to say, ‚ÄúIt is I,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt was he who dropped the phone in shock when Jodie answered, ‚ÄòThis is she,‚Äô‚Äù because ‚Äúhe‚Äù is the same type of pronoun as ‚ÄúI.‚Äù\n\n> Here are some more correct examples:\n\n> Who called Jodie? It was he.\n\n> Who told you about it? It was I.\n\n> Who had the phone conversation? It must have been they.\n\n> Who cares? It is we.\n\n> Now the problem is that 90 percent of you are almost certainly thinking, ‚ÄúWell, that all sounds really weird. Is she serious?‚Äù\n\n> Yes, I‚Äôm serious, and that is the traditional rule, but fortunately most grammarians forgive you for not following the rule. In her aptly titled book ‚ÄúWoe Is I,‚Äù Patricia O‚ÄôConnor notes that almost everyone says, ‚ÄúIt is me,‚Äù and that the ‚ÄúIt is I‚Äù construction is almost extinct (1).\n\n> The Merriam-Webster Dictionary of English Usage says that it‚Äôs a style choice, and that ‚ÄúIt is I‚Äù is a formal style and ‚ÄúIt is me‚Äù is a more casual style. In fact, most people who write about language agree that unless you‚Äôre answering the phone for the English department at the University of Chicago or responding to a Supreme Court judge‚Äîin other words, in a very formal situation for the English language‚Äî‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me‚Äù is an acceptable answer (2, 3, 4)."}

{"prompt": "F√∂rst, etta, ettan", "completion": "As a native speaker, I would say that you explained it perfectly. \n\nWell, except that we say \"113 stops here\" = *hundratretton stannar h√§r*,\" without any \"the\" around whatsoever. And it's the \"it stops\" verb form I'm using here, of course, not the \"several stops\" noun form. \n\nIt's a quirk of 13-19 (the ones ending in *-ton* in Swedish and \"-teen\" in English), plus higher numbers that end with those, so it doesn't matter whether it's line 13, 113, 213 etc, it's always the base form of the number when tallking about bus, tram, train and ferry lines. Hence the aforementioned *hundratretton*. \n\nOutside of this range, you either say e.g. *linje fyra stannar h√§r* (\"line four stops here\") or *fyran stannar h√§r* (\"the four stops here\") and it means the same thing. And if it's line 104, it will similarly be *linje hundrafyra* (\"line hundred-four\") or *hundrafyran* (\"the hundred-four\") depending on what you feel like saying in that moment. \n\nEdit: \"Line twenty\" is thus either *linje tjugo* or *tjugan*, \"line thirty\" *linje trettio* or *trettian*, and so on. And \"line thirty-four\" is *linje trettiofyra* or *trettiofyran*. \n\nEdit 2: We treat house/building numbers the same way we do bus lines.

{"prompt": "F√∂rst, etta, ettan", "completion": "> \"Line twenty\" is thus either linje *tjugo* or *tjugan*, \"line thirty\" linje *trettio* or *trettian*, and so on.\n\nThat's a dialectal matter. \n\n*Tjuga* is a fairly established nominalization of the numeral, but would not be universally used for public transport. Words like *trettia* and beyond aren't even that, and the use of \"trettian\" are not universal in any context. \n\n0-12 (and by extension larger 'teen'-less digits that end in 1-9) are what they are because the cardinal numerals (noll, tv√•, sju, tolv‚Ä¶) all have corresponding nouns established (nolla, tv√•a, sjua, tolva‚Ä¶). The teens and tens typically don't.\n\nNo numeral has a definite form. A corresponding noun may, but not all numerals have such."}

Or, to be very 'literal': \"det finns minst ett x som har egenskapen P(x), och det g√§ller f√∂r alla y, att om y har egenskapen P(y), s√• √§r y identisk med x\".\n\n~‚àÉxP(x) - \"Det √§r inte s√•, att det finns n√•got x som har egenskapen P(x)\" or \"det finns inget x som egenskapen P(x)\" or \"inget x har egenskapen P(x)\".\n\n~‚àÄxP(x) - \"Det √§r inte s√•, att det g√§ller f√∂r alla x, att de har egenskapen P(x)\" or \"det √§r inte s√• att alla x har egenskapen P(x)\".\n\n**NB**: ‚àÄx~P(x) - \"Det g√§ller f√∂r alla x, att de inte har egenskapen P(x)\", is confusingly close to \"alla x har inte egenskapen P(x)\", but the latter means ~‚àÄxP(x).\n\n‚àÉx~P(x) - \"Det finns minst ett x, s√•dant att det inte har egenskapen P(x)\" or \"n√•got x har inte egenskapen P(x)\".\n\nWhere \"har egenskapen\" means \"has the property\", and can of course be replaced with truth, e.g. ‚àÉxP(x) - \"Det finns n√•got x, f√∂r vilket det √§r sant att P(x)\".\n\nIt will often be shortened in conversation, e.g. ‚àÄxPx - \"f√∂r alla x, P(x)\".\n\n\"N√•got\" can be switched to \"n√•gra\" if you know that there is more than one."}

I'm trying to construct a sentence that would illuminate the difference from a practical point of view...\n\n\n\nMy problem is that English isn't really logically consistent (grammar is interfering):\n\"He wants something\" but \"Does he want anything?\" \n\nIn this case, \"anything\" does not mean \"everything\" anymore, it is suddenly related to \"something\" instead.  Now, I'm not a native English speaker but I feel that that \"Does he want something?\" at least is less idiomatic. I don't know if it'd be grammatically wrong, per se.\n\nSwedish on the other hand is more consistent in this case: \"han vill ha n√•got\" / \"vill han ha n√•got?\" (=Is there at least one item that he wants).\n\nAnd then there's the case of \"He wants nothing\" or \"He doesn't want anything\" which to my non-native ears sounds fairly synonymous. Which would make \"anything\" an antonym of \"nothing\", which logically feels closer to \"something\" than to \"everything\"...\nThe equivalent Swedish would them be \"han vill ingenting\" and \"han vill inte n√•gonting\"\n\n\n\nWriting this makes me realize I don't know why I sometimes use \"n√•got\" and sometimes \"n√•gonting\" (and equivalent for the other words). I'll leave those be for the moment. \n\n\nTranslations so far: \n\nNothing = \"inget\"\n\nSomething = \"n√•got\"\n\nAnything = \"n√•got\" if in a question or if the verb is negated*; \"vad som helst\" otherwise\n\nEverything = \"allt\"\n\n\n*Because of course there's also a distinction between \"he doesn't want anything\" and \"he wants not just anything\" - where \"anything\" fills different logical roles, and Swedish would, for the second example, negate \"vad som helst\".\n\n\n----\n\nAnd then there's the Swedish grammar, where...\n\n1. ingen/inget/inga and n√•gon/n√•got/n√•gra are inflected for the gender and number of the relevant noun. \n2. \"Vad som helst\" is for objects (-thing), \"vem som helst\" for people (-one)\n3. \"Alla\" is for countable nouns, \"all\"/\"allt\" for uncountable, and \"allt\" is also some kind of dummy construction when there is no explicit reference.
